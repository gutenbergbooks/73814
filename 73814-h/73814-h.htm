<h2 class="nobreak">FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p>Amos R. Wells said, “Recreation is re-creation, or a
re-fashioning of the soul in the image of God wherein
it was created.”</p>

<p>Real recreation is just that. All through the war
every effort was made to fill the leisure time of soldiers
and sailors with recreation rather than dissipation, the
kind of recreation that made leisure time an asset rather
than a liability. Since the war, with the great impetus
it gave the movement, recreation work in churches, in
communities, in schools, and in almost every kind of
social service work, has been put on the same constructive
basis, and it is being looked upon not merely as a
side issue or as “entertainment,” but rather is respected
as one of the most vital forces for a re-fashioning
of souls in the image of God wherein they were
created.</p>

<p>“It Is to Laugh” was written for the purpose of answering
requests of re-creators everywhere, who are in
constant need of new material in their recreative work.
The games and stunts described do “entertain,” but behind
the inevitable resultant hearty, healthy laughter
is the re-creation that gives one a new lease on life,
that makes one sure that life is good to live, and that
helps one to live life joyfully and abundantly. If
“It Is to Laugh” may help in accomplishing this, it will
have served its purpose.</p>

<p>Many of the ideas for these games are not original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
but have come from co-workers in the Y.W.C.A., from
members of training classes at the University of Chicago,
and from delegates to recreational conferences all
over the country, and I wish in this way to express
my sincere appreciation of their coöperation, and to
thank them for their invaluable assistance in promoting
the gospel of re-creation.</p>

<small>MIXERS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The time set for the party is 8 o’clock, but by 8:15
there are about twenty arrivals instead of the one
hundred expected, and they are standing about stiff and
formal, politely ready to do anything the program committee
asks, so that they may go home feeling virtuous
in having done their duty, but dangerously near the
attitude of mind that will tempt them, the next time a
party is announced, to follow Rebecca’s example of
“letting duty go to smash!”—all this unless something
happens, and that, right away!</p>

<p>At one time we might have met this situation by
putting on a simple little game to keep those twenty
guests there until the rest of the crowd came, but it was
hardly necessary to make that mistake twice to realize
the futility of those tactics. Any game is a flat failure
that does not call forth a real social spirit and a real
play spirit, but that spirit does not just happen. It
must be definitely worked for and created through
socializing games, while just “fill-ins till the crowd
comes” can utterly ruin the prospects for creating that
spirit that makes recreation, re-creation. For example,
“The Gathering of the Nuts” invariably brings down
the house when it is given its right place in an evening’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
program, but presented at the first of the evening when
guests are straggling in, one by one, and there is as
yet no relaxation and group spirit, it would inevitably
be a dismal failure.</p>

<p>Therefore, instead of putting on some casual stunt
just to keep guests from leaving, or just to fill in time
till the other guests arrive, we have found it far more
advisable to have informal group singing around the
piano for the first ten or fifteen minutes, and then begin
the evening proper, even if there are only some twenty
or thirty guests present, with a game that is very definitely
a mixer, the one purpose of which is not so much
to entertain as to “socialize,” in almost every case the
mixer being some big general movement in which there
is a lot of fun and nonsense just like there is in the
games that follow later, but with this important difference—that
every person present is in this first event in
some game that pries him loose from the corner he chose
on arrival as his abiding place for the evening; a game
that gives him an incentive other than a sense of duty
for shaking hands vigorously with his fellow guests;
a game that makes him feel this party as his own personal
responsibility; in short, a game which shows him
that he alone counts as nothing, but that he, together
with every other guest present, counts for everything.</p>

<p>“Spots” is a splendid example of a mixer that will
so thoroughly mix up a group of guests that they never
will succeed in getting sorted out again into their original
classifications:</p>


<h4>Spots.</h4>

<p>The leader has chosen seven or eight places in the
room as the “spots,” and has a list of them at hand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
All of them have been carefully chosen, and she alone
knows where they are. Guests are standing about informally
when the announcement is made that in about
two minutes a whistle will be blown, at which time the
couple standing on a certain spot will receive a handsome
reward. At the same time however, anyone seen
standing alone will be fined. A partner is essential to
winning a prize or to make one immune to a fine. Even
if a person is standing on the lucky spot at the time the
whistle blows, if he is alone he must pay the fine, one
cent.</p>

<p>To promote a general moving around, and to add to
the spirit of the game, lively march music is played all
the time the guests are supposed to be moving, although
no definite line of march is encouraged.</p>

<p>Two additional rules insure the success of “Spots.”
After the first spot has been found and the prize
awarded, the game goes on and another spot in some
other part of the room is the lucky one. But no person
can have the same partner he had while the first spot
was being sought. The same fine of one cent is imposed
on any two people who seem to think they have an option
on each other.</p>

<p>The same thing is true of location. Anyone found
standing in the same place he occupied during the first
round, is fined, with much publicity.</p>

<p>The game goes on until the seven or eight spots have
been located and the “handsome rewards” given out.
All the spots have been chosen with the purpose in mind
to get guests absolutely relaxed, thoroughly mixed
and free from any stiff formality. That is why a definite
line of march would be fatal. Instead, let the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
spot be behind the piano; the next on the platform; the
next leaning up against a pillar, etc., etc.</p>

<p>To sum up, the rules are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Everyone must have a partner.</p>

<p>2. Partners must be changed for every round.</p>

<p>3. No one is allowed to stand in the same place for
two successive rounds.</p>
</div>

<p>Four or five so-called “policemen” assist the leader
in detecting violators of these rules and much publicity
is given the fining of the offenders.</p>

<p>The success of the game depends entirely on the
ability of the leader to make her guests feel the great
desirability of finding one of those elusive lucky spots.
No one knows where they are. All they know is that
it behooves them to move, to get a partner, to keep
moving, and to keep on getting partners!</p>


<h4>Shake Hands!</h4>

<p>Now shake hands, everybody, whether you know each
other or not. Let’s be sociable. Shake hands!</p>

<p>You have heard that before? And immediately you
started in to shake hands with friend and foe and
foreigner? Hardly. No real incentive is offered there
for shaking hands with people you have never seen
before or people you see every day of your life, no
incentive other than a sense of duty, and a sense of
duty is not what one would call particularly successful
in promoting the real spirit of sociability which makes
a social evening, or the lack of which, breaks it.</p>

<p>It does seem so inane to ask people to shake hands
with each other, and yet, if a leader can once get a
group to laugh heartily as a group, if she can give them
a sufficiently interesting incentive for grasping the hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
of a neighbor with real vim and enthusiasm even if it is
for the purpose of saving themselves from dire penalties!—they
are won and one for the rest of the evening!
But just telling guests to be sociable and to shake hands
will not do it.</p>

<p>It is necessary to create a setting and furnish an
incentive, and instead of playing on the guest’s sense
of duty, to play on their sense of humor.</p>

<p>They are invited to shake hands with each other, but
are warned that the only handshake allowed is a vigorous
side-to-side swing, and are further cautioned that it
is fully as great a crime to be seen using the ordinary
handshake as it is to be caught not shaking hands at
all; that several “policemen” in the crowd will see to it
that these laws are enforced; and finally, that any violator
of these laws will certainly repent at leisure and in
public.</p>

<p>Some ten policemen are chosen, their number of course
depending on the size of the group. At a signal the
handshaking begins. The policemen are more than vigilant
in discharging their duties, and several culprits who
were caught standing about “just looking on”, and
some of the ladies who shook hands in a manner not
vigorous enough to suit the policemen, are escorted to
the platform, there to sit in the public eye till the
leader’s whistle stops the frantic, vigorous handshaking,
which should be given about five minutes time.</p>

<p>The next game of the evening might well be a hoax,
with these culprits used as the victims.</p>


<h4>Southpaws.</h4>

<p>This is very much like “Shake Hands” in its object
and in its rulings. The difference lies in the kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
handshaking permitted. The rule is that the left hand
only is to be used in shaking hands. At irregular
intervals a whistle is blown and anyone caught not actually
shaking the left hand of some other guest at that
particular moment is punished in the same way in which
culprits in the game “Shake Hands!” are taken care of.</p>

<p>Of course there are policemen, whose one object in
life is to catch someone napping, or a bit negligent in
the evidence he gives of a very active and left-handed
spirit of sociability!</p>


<h4>My Virtues!</h4>

<p>“Mrs. Kalen, let me present Mr. Black.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Frummly, have you met Mr. Stewart?” and
so on, world without end! This, at a large gathering,
the one object of which is to get members of a community
to really know each other! And at that, if it
were possible for the hosts to see that every guest was
introduced to every other guest, would even that do a
great deal toward helping members of a community to
know each other, other than to have spoken one another’s
names? Put a human and socializing element in those
introductions, and they will know more about each other
than just names, and what’s more, they’ll like each
other!</p>

<p>The men form one line and the women another, all
of them facing the front of the room. When the music
starts the men march down one side of the room to the
back, and the women down the other. They meet and
take partners as they come in the line of march, coming
up the center of the room with their partners. When
they reach the front, all couples march to the right,
forming a large double circle around the room. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
leader then makes an announcement to the effect that in
order to make sure that everyone knows all the virtues
of his fellow guests, splendid opportunities will be given
for the flaunting of those virtues. Partners face each
other, shake hands, introduce themselves, and then, with
hands on hips, begin telling all the nice things they
know about themselves, real or imaginary.</p>

<p>The only difficulty is that they have to do it at the
same time, which makes it hard occasionally for one’s
partner to hear about all the lovely qualities one possesses
or aspires to possess! They are given just a
minute for this when another whistle is blown which is
a signal for the men only to walk forward until a second
whistle stops them. The woman nearest them is their
next partner. They shake hands with these new partners,
and one’s virtues again become the topic of importance.</p>

<p>This continues for not more than five minutes. That
will be enough!</p>

<p>Is it necessary to say that next day, when Mrs. Kalen
meets Mr. Black at the bank, that she doesn’t wonder,
“Have I ever met that man before?” Rather, it is,
“Why, good morning, Mr. Black! Are you still the
perfect man you thought yourself last night?”</p>


<h4>Prohibited Words.</h4>

<p>We have used over and over again the game in which
certain words are prohibited, but we used it as a game
that had a definite time limit. It has proved far more
effective to put a ban on those words for the entire
evening. Perhaps these words are “Yes” and “No,”
or “You” and “I.” All through the evening those
words are forbidden. Anyone heard using them pays<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
a fine to the one who caught him making that social
error.</p>

<p>At each offense a fine of one candy or one bean or
one of whatever thing is used as the means of exchange,
is exacted from the one who made the error. This means
of exchange may depend on the season. On Valentine
Day it might be little candy hearts in small bags; at
Easter, little candy eggs; or at Christmas, tiny bright
red candies. However, just plain beans may be used,
a small bag being provided in which to carry them.</p>

<p>Perhaps you think that if candy is used, your guests
may eat their means of exchange before the evening is
half over. Warn them against it. Then, at the end
of the evening, just before the last game, ask for a count
of their “money,” and as it happens, “To him that
hath shall be given.” The richest one is given additional
riches in the shape of a box of candy, with the
assurance that he need not open it till he gets home!
The ten who made the most lapses and consequently
have the least money, and those who ate most of their
money, are obliged to give up any they still hold and
to sit on the platform as the infant class while their
brighter and less greedy brothers and sisters march past
them, munching their candy!</p>

<p>It is easy enough to remember not to say “Yes” or
“No” to anyone, when that is the particular game of
the moment, but to have to remember not to use those
words through all the nonsense of the evening is a
slightly different matter. Another very good phase of
this game as a mixer is that it gives a real incentive
for people to talk to each other, even if they have never
seen one another before—all for the sake of a bean!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>


<h4>Gossip.</h4>

<p>A circle is formed, with from three to six people in
the center, their number to be determined by the size
of the circle. Guests are warned that it is the object
of these people in the center to get out of it, and that
the only way they can do it is to get someone else in,
in their place; that their method of doing this is very
effective, and that it behooves every last one of them to
learn the name and occupation of his neighbor on either
side, together with one juicy bit of gossip concerning
him.</p>

<p>At a signal from the leader, each one of the people in
the center turns around, snaps his fingers at some person
who did not expect it, and asks this victim to instantly
give all the required information about both of
his neighbors. If he fails, into the center he goes,
changing places with the person who caught him napping.</p>

<p>The neighbor is supposed to offer the juicy bit of
gossip himself, but sometimes his imagination fails him,
or his egotism overcomes him, and it is up to the victim
pointed at to use his own imagination. Therefore it is
not unusual to have the following information shouted
out by an excited victim who fears a place in the center:
“My right-hand neighbor’s name is The Minister; his occupation
is ministering and he has been in jail four
times!”</p>

<p>All the others in the center have been asking for information
at the same time and after a minute or two
the leader calls out, “Change your neighbors!” and
everyone is to find a new set of neighbors for himself.
A great deal of publicity and a place in the center is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
promised anyone who does not get into a new neighborhood!</p>

<p>This game is played not more than five minutes, for
with such an incentive all guests will know each other
intimately long before five minutes are over!</p>


<h4>It Pays to Advertise.</h4>

<p>As each guest comes in the door he is given a slip of
paper on which is written a number. When all the
guests have arrived the leader asks all “tens” to
congregate at the piano, while “threes” get together
in one corner, “fives” in another, etc., etc. As the
different groups assemble the leader goes rapidly from
one group to another, and reading from her list, assigns
each group some advertisement which they are to
dramatize. A few impromptu properties such as a
shrunken sweater, candles, newspapers, and crackers,
are available.</p>

<p>After the four or five minutes allowed for preparation,
each group in turn dramatizes the advertisement assigned
it, and must continue action until the audience
guesses correctly what advertisement is being represented.
To avoid the situation which often develops
when such a contest is on, an announcement is made
to the effect that there is to be no guessing until the
actors have completed their stunt. Then if there is
no correct guess, the dramatization must begin again
and continue until it is made so realistic that the
audience guesses what it is in self-defense, or else gives
up in dismay!</p>

<p>The following suggestions may be helpful:</p>

<p>1. <i>Ivory Soap.</i> “<i>It Floats.</i>” Members of the group
go flitting about the stage as though they were walking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
on air, waving their arms and in general acting in
ethereal fashion.</p>

<p>2. <i>Eversharp.</i> Riddles which have been prepared
beforehand are put to a class by the teacher. The class
having been thoroughly drilled in the answers, respond
with a snap and a brilliancy that amazes the audience!</p>

<p>3. <i>Uneeda Biscuit.</i> Let them pantomime exhaustion,
plainly showing by their actions that they are starved.
A doctor rushes in, makes them stick out their tongues,
(which they do with artistic effect), sing up the scale,
blow up their cheeks, holding them that way indefinitely,
close one eye, etc. In short, he carefully diagnoses the
case, after which he swells up with pride at having
found what the trouble was. He dashes to his bag, takes
out a box of crackers, and makes each patient eat one,
whereupon they all hop around, exhibiting marvelous
life and enthusiasm, apparently cured for life.</p>

<p>4. <i>Blue Jay Corn Plaster.</i> The men of the group
take the part of the blue jays, blue because of aching
corns which they indicate by a mournful expression and
painful hobbling around. The “jay” element is taken
care of by tousled hair and disheveled clothing. They
give evidence of considerable pain, which evidence
grows louder and louder until the women of the group
come dashing in as nurses, with handkerchiefs or pieces
of white cloth bound about their heads. They inquire
in pantomime about the cause of such evident trouble
and having learned it, bind up the entire foot of the
patient, thereby making life again worth living for the
“Blue Jays.”</p>

<p>5. <i>Whistle.</i> It speaks for itself.</p>

<p>6. <i>Bon Ami.</i> The men come running in with smudges
on their faces, followed in great haste by the ladies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
who are very evidently trying to catch them. Finally
they succeed and holding their victims firmly by the
shoulders, with handkerchiefs as instruments of torture
they pantomime a vigorous face-scrubbing, polishing the
face as they would a window. When they have finished,
they view the results with much satisfaction, while their
victims pantomime the discomfort they undoubtedly feel.</p>

<p>7. <i>Pears’ Soap.</i> All the members of a group are
“paired” off and either wander about in pairs or busily
wash each others’ faces, always in pairs.</p>

<p>8. <i>Colgate’s Toothpaste.</i> “Lies flat on the brush.”
A man appears, throws a hairbrush on the floor and
lies down “flat upon it.”</p>

<p>9. <i>Wool Soap.</i> A large lady whose arms are sticking
through the sleeves of a white sweater many sizes too
small for her, looks tragically at the result of her not
having used Wool Soap, while the rest of the group
go into spasms of mirth at the picture she presents.</p>

<p>10. <i>Fiske Tires.</i> “Time to Retire.” All the members
of this group file stumblingly across the stage, each
one carrying a candle and yawning, and looking so irresistibly
sleepy that everyone in the audience yawns just
to look at them!</p>

<p>With some groups it will not be necessary to provide
advertisements, and it will be sufficient to announce that
each group is to think of its own and that a prize will
be given to the most original stunt, but with the average
group it is very helpful to have either a list of advertisements
at hand, together with properties, or to be
sure that in each group there is someone who can be
depended upon to take the initiative for that group in
putting on a really effective stunt. I speak from experience!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>


<h4>Limited Conversation.</h4>

<p>Perhaps you are responsible for the “socializing” of
a very large group, most of the guests being strangers
to each other, and you wish to break the ice and to get
guests into the spirit that makes for easy and truly
social conversation.</p>

<p>To announce certain topics of conversation and ask
that everyone talk on just those topics with one’s neighbors
in such a group as has just been described, often
has an effect that is more tongue-tieing than socializing
in its effect, and a human kink must be put into the plan
to make it really effective in getting your guests into
the relaxed and jovial spirit that does wonders with a
group, however large or “strange.”</p>

<p>A list of topics for conversation is made out as usual,
but a ruling is added that makes conversation on these
topics far more difficult and therefore far more interesting
than just plain conversation which is very evidently
for the purpose of “mixing up” a strange group.
That ruling might be that every statement must be the
very opposite of what one really thinks about the question
of the moment. For example, the question may be,
“Do you believe in Woman Suffrage?” According to
the ruling, no matter how thoroughly a man despises
the thought of Woman Suffrage, he is obliged to vehemently
defend it, and no matter how ardent a suffragette
his immediate neighbor may be, she is to scorn it with
every breath.</p>

<p>After a minute or two the next topic is announced.
It might be “What do you like best?” and everyone is
to pick upon the thing he most dislikes and eulogize it
to the best of his ability. That same ruling applies to
all the six or seven topics announced, and to say the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
least, startling statements are the result, to say nothing
of the hilarity that is inevitable over a conversation with
the Baptist minister’s wife who vows that picking potato
bugs is her favorite pastime!</p>

<p>This group is a large one, so no effort is made to pair
guests off with partners but topics are announced, together
with the ruling that one’s immediate neighbors
are one’s partners, and that guards will patrol the room
to see that no one talks on any subject but the one
announced, to see that everyone <i>is</i> talking, and that the
limitation imposed is very strictly observed. To make
sure that they talk to more than one person the guests
are asked to change their immediate neighborhoods between
topics. The breaking of any of these rules calls
for a forfeit.</p>

<p>If one is entertaining a small group in a home, a
progressive system of partners is arranged, by which
guests progress from one partner to another. Each one
is given a card on which a number is written, ladies
holding even numbers and men, odd. On the men’s
cards in addition, is written their conversation program,
namely, the numbers of the partners they are to have
for the different topics of conversation, and it is their
business to hunt up each new partner as the signal for
the change is given. For example, Mr. Hunt is No. 5.
His program reads: 6, 8, 2, 12, 4, 10. That means that
for the first topic his partner is to be No. 6 and that
when the game starts he is to hunt her up and talk
earnestly with her on the first topic. A bell is rung
after about two minutes and he must hunt up No. 8
and talk with her about the second topic, and so he
progresses from one partner to another until he has
talked with his last partner on the last topic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>Another limitation which may be applied to conversation
is that all statements must contain one’s own
initials. The question may be, “What is your favorite
sport?” Mr. Graham’s initials are S. M. G. so his
favorite sport is obliged to be, “Selling moldy groceries!”</p>

<p>Still another limitation maybe that all remarks be
untruths. A further limitation, and a painful one, but
one which is particularly good for a small crowd, is that
all statements must be made in rhyme, no matter how
inevitably abominable the rhyming may be!</p>

<p>Topics may include any possible subject, from current
events to modes of dress. The following list is typical:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. What is your favorite sport?</p>

<p>2. Do you believe in Protective Tariff?</p>

<p>3. Will bobbed hair stay with us?</p>

<p>4. Who is your favorite poet?</p>

<p>5. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>6. What do you like best to eat?</p>

<p>7. What would you like to be?</p>
</div>

<p>A period of two or three minutes is given for each
conversation. The whole affair should last not longer
than from fifteen to twenty minutes. You will find that
that will be plenty long enough! Imagine a period not
longer than that for a conversation on the above topics,
carried on in rhyme!</p>

<p>The following are the answers given by the principal
of the High School at a church party in a Middle West
town:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. “To ride a big fat elephant has always been my
favorite stunt.”</p>

<p>2. “I’d hate to have you think I’m rude, but what is
it, a breakfast food?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>3. “I really don’t profess to know, but I hope to
goodness it will go.”</p>

<p>4. “Walt Mason is my favorite poet, he’s got the
goods and he can show it.”</p>

<p>5. “I am a banker brave and bold; I grab the cash
and keep it cold.”</p>

<p>6. “Most everything’s what I like best; to get enough,
there lies the test.”</p>

<p>7. “I’d like to be a billionaire and make the whole
world stand and stare.”</p>
</div>


<h4>Holidays.</h4>

<p>The question as to their birthmonths is asked of the
guests, and they are grouped together accordingly, the
Januarys over behind the piano, the Junes at the rear
entrance, etc., etc. Each group is then asked to dramatize
a holiday of the month it represents. No properties
have been made available as this is to be distinctly an
impromptu affair. They are all given about ten minutes
for preparation, and then they are called on, one by
one, to do their stunts. They are not called by name
however, but by “location.” For example, the first
group called on might be the one in the bay window,
and the next, the one in the dining room.</p>

<p>When each group has finished its stunt, and only then,
the audience is to guess what holiday they represent,
and if the guesses are incorrect, the stunt must be
repeated.</p>

<p>The following list of holidays has been found to work
to good advantage.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#160; 1. January—New Year.</p>

<p>&#160; 2. February—Washington’s birthday.</p>

<p>&#160; 3. March—St. Patrick’s Day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<p>&#160; 4. April—April Fool’s Day.</p>

<p>&#160; 5. May—May Day.</p>

<p>&#160; 6. June—Anybody’s Wedding.</p>

<p>&#160; 7. July—July Fourth.</p>

<p>&#160; 8. August—Mr. Ribbon Clerk’s Vacation.</p>

<p>&#160; 9. September—Labor Day.</p>

<p>10. October—Hallowe’en.</p>

<p>11. November—Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>12. December—Christmas.</p>
</div>


<h4>Bag Handshake.</h4>

<p>Each guest is given a paper bag which is to be put on
his right hand. He is to shake hands with everyone in
sight, the bag being an indicator of how zealous he has
been in his efforts! As soon as it is worn out he may
rest in peace, but not until then.</p>


<h4>The Little Theater.</h4>

<p>The plan of “Holidays” is used over and over with
different “motives.” One of them is musical. The
words of a song like “Yankee Doodle” are written out
on separate slips which are numbered alike. They might
all be numbered. “1.” The second song might be
“Dixie,” and its words are similarly written out on
slips and numbered “2.” Each guest is given a number
and is asked to find all others who have the same
number. When everyone has found his or her group
they are to have just a very few minutes in which to
practice their song. When the time is up the leader
calls out each group in turn and asks them to sing their
song, at the same time putting enough dramatic action
into their performance to really get the motive of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
song across! The group which the judges agree on as
best gets a bag of peanuts.</p>


<h4>Dressing Up.</h4>

<p>There is nothing like “dressing up” to make a crowd
relax and laugh. Therefore, with a large group of
guests, most of them strangers to one another, use caps
and bells for as successful a mixer as you could desire.
Fancy paper caps can be bought very inexpensively
when bought in quantity, and the same is true of tiny
bells. Each guest is provided with a little bell which
has a string attached by which to hang it around his
neck, and also one of these foolish paper caps. They
are all asked to put on both bells and caps and to keep
them on all evening.</p>

<p>A crowd of guests thusly adorned looks foolish enough
to furnish entertainment for a long, long time!</p>


<h4>Circle Handshake.</h4>

<p>It is good psychology to have a genuine mixer at the
end of the evening as well as at the beginning. After
the last game, the guests form a circle. The leader asks
the one standing nearest the door to shake hands with
his right-hand neighbor, and then to continue shaking
hands all the way around the circle, telling each one
“Good-night” until he has gone completely around,
after which he drops out of the circle. At the same time
however, all the others are beginning to do the same
thing. He had no sooner finished shaking hands with
his right-hand neighbor and gone on to the next one
and then on to the next, than this same right-hand
neighbor began doing the same thing, shaking the hand
of <i>his</i> neighbor to the right, and so on around the circle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Each one does the same thing, that is, after No. 2 has
passed No. 3, No. 3 starts immediately to shake hands
around the circle, and as soon as he passes No. 4, No. 4
does the same thing.</p>

<p>In this way it is inevitable that everyone shakes hands
with everyone else and bids them all “Good-night.”</p>

<small>GROUP GAMES.</small></h2>
</div>

<h3><i>Games for Small Groups.</i></h3>


<h4>Altruism.</h4>

<p>Each one is asked to write out a stunt that any ordinary
person could do. These stunts are collected, mixed
up and then passed around, although nothing has been
said about this having been planned! Each person is
then requested to do the stunt written out on the slip
of paper given him, whether he can or not!</p>


<h4>Cruelty.</h4>

<p>In this game each one is asked to write out a stunt
that he would hate to have to do himself. When these
stunts are all written out, an announcement is made to
the effect that, in turn, they will all please perform
the stunts they so kindly thought of.</p>


<h4>Noise.</h4>

<p>Each guest is asked to choose the part of some very
well-known barnyard animal. The leader is to read a
story she has written which is all about barnyard animals
and which makes frequent mention of all of them.
As she mentions each different animal, the noise it
makes is to be imitated by the one who chose that
particular animal. But whenever she speaks of the
donkey everyone in the room is to imitate the donkey
to the best of his ability and at the top of his lungs!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span></p>


<h4>The Toyshop.</h4>

<p>The entire group is supposed to have been on a shopping
expedition on which toys only were purchased.
They are not to tell what they bought but when called
on, each one is to imitate the sound and action of her
toy, and is to continue doing so until the name of the
toy is guessed.</p>


<h4>Smile!</h4>

<p>Guests are either sitting or standing in two lines
facing each other. The hostess, who holds a boy’s cap
in her hand, tells one side that the inside of the cap is
the signal for them to act, and the other side that the
top of the cap is their signal. She stands between the
rows and throws the cap up into the air. If it lands
on the floor bottom side up, the side which has the inside
of the cap for a signal must immediately go into roars
of laughter, or they may giggle, simper, tee-hee, or show
mirth in any way in their efforts to make the other side
smile even the least little bit. Anyone who does smile
at all goes over to the side of the enemy in disgrace.</p>

<p>The hostess acts as timekeeper and after a few seconds
she throws the cap into the air again, and if it lands
right side up the other group becomes hilarious and puts
forth every effort to gain new members. After about
three minutes of this, the hostess announces that each
side will have one more turn (she manages to throw
the cap so that will happen), that a count will be taken
at the end of that time, and that the side which gained
the most new members gets almost all of the refreshments,
and the other side almost none of them!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>


<h4>And I.</h4>

<p>Choose three people who are quickwitted. The first
of the three goes around the circle quietly giving everyone
a name; the second, an action; and the last one a
place. When each guest has been told a name, an action,
and a place, the hostess begins the fairy tale by making
a sentence of the three things told her, adding however
“and I” to the name given her. For example, she has
been given the following. “Grandmother,” “Cracking
the whip,” “Baptist Church.” Her sentence would be
“Grandmother and I were cracking the whip in the
Baptist Church!” The one to her right then takes up
the tale. Her assignment was: “Hired man,” “Getting
a permanent wave,” “In the shade of the old apple
tree.” Her sentence is, “The hired man and I were
getting a permanent wave in the shade of the old apple
tree.”</p>

<p>So it continues around the circle, and a weirder set
of experiences never occurred!</p>


<h4>Impromptu Artists.</h4>

<p>Pass around pencils and paper. Assign a “model”
to each artist, in every case having model and artist
across from each other if possible. This arrangement
makes every guest both an artist and a model. At a
signal they begin their artistry and are given three
minutes in which to draw portraits of the models assigned.
All artists must put their names on their pictures,
but models’ names are omitted. The pictures are
collected at the end of three minutes, are shuffled and
again passed around.</p>

<p>Each guest must decide who he thinks was the model
for the picture he holds. He writes that person’s name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
on the picture and when all have done that, the pictures
are given to the suspected models. Violence has been
committed with less cause! <i>Occasionally</i> someone picks
a wrong model! That is why, at a signal from the
hostess each one in turn turns over his picture and
reads aloud the name of the artist as well as the name
written on the portrait, and the artist is compelled to
tell who his model was, regardless of what the picture
looks like.</p>

<p>That is a good time to break up the party!</p>


<h4>Excuse Me!</h4>

<p>A question is put to the group as a whole: “Why
weren’t you at the meeting last night?” In two minutes
each one is to be ready to give his excuse, and the
only requirement is that the excuse is to be put in terms
of one’s own initials, and to be preceded by “Because
I was——”</p>

<p>For example, one guest’s initials are “C. F. B.”
When asked why she wasn’t at the meeting last night
she glibly replied, “Because I was curling Father’s
beard!”</p>


<h4>Invitations.</h4>

<p>Guests are standing about informally. The topic of
conversation is, “Why I want you to come to call!”
Each girl is asked to choose a man whom she will invite
to call on her. Sue Lawson chooses Ned Parsons, and
she is to urge him to accept her invitation to call but
she will have to give him a mighty good reason for
wanting him. He is to accept and is to tell her why
he is so glad to come. In both cases one’s partner’s
initials are of importance, for the reason one gives is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
to be based on them. Miss Lawson tells Mr. Parsons
that he just must come to call because he “needs protection,”
and he tells her that he will be glad to because
she is “so lovely!”</p>

<p>Three minutes are given for invitations and their
acceptances at the end of which time the leader starts
calling for a report. “Ted Frazer, who invited you to
call?”</p>

<p>“Gertrude Field. She said she wanted me to call
because I was ‘turrible funny,’” whereupon the leader
calls upon Gertrude Field to ask why Mr. Frazer wanted
to accept her invitation. She replies, “To get a ‘good
feed’!”</p>


<h4>Elastic Spelling.</h4>

<p>Let the host start spelling a word by giving the first
letter. For example, he may have in mind the word
“kitchen.” He says “K,” and the one to his left who
is to give the next letter is thinking of “kill” so he says
“I,” while the next one who is thinking of “kimono”
says “M,” each one trying not to give a letter that will
complete a word. The penalty for completing a word
is to become a third of a goat. At the second offence
the penalty is to become two-thirds of a goat, and at
the third, a whole goat. A whole goat is compelled to
“Baa, baa” at his turn instead of giving a letter.
There are always more “Baa-ers” than one would anticipate,
for even though you had in mind the word
“kidnap,” when at your turn you added the letter
“d” to “k—i—,” k—i—d spells kid, at least in the
English language, so you go on record as part of a goat.</p>

<p>There is always somebody who will take a chance and
give “any old letter,” just so he won’t finish a word.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Each player has the privilege of challenging three
separate times. When challenged, a player is obliged
to tell the word he had in mind, which sometimes he had
not! A player cannot be challenged after the next
player has given his letter.</p>

<p>It is not only the English language that is stretched
in this indoor pastime. Minds and imaginations stretch
to the bursting point in a way that gives one a new respect
for one’s capacity for laughter.</p>


<h4>Twentieth Century Blind Man’s Buff.</h4>

<p>Instead of just one being blindfolded, all but one are
blinded, and it is the business of the game to catch this
lucky one. He is not as lucky as it might appear, however.
He has a little bell hanging around his neck on
a cord, and to say the least, it advertises his whereabouts.
He cannot leave the room, must keep moving,
and cannot silence the bell in any way. At that, in the
average room he can elude his pursuers for a few
minutes at least, if he is nimble at all, for you know
how utterly helpless one is when blindfolded (and how
very graceful!).</p>

<p>As soon as the bell man is caught he is blindfolded
and the one who caught him is “it.” The game is a
hilarious success for about four or five minutes, but do
not let it run on any longer than that or people will
be getting uncomfortable and taking off their blindfolders
and “Just watching this time, thank you!”</p>

<p>Are you wondering how in the world you could ever
get enough large size handkerchiefs to blindfold a
whole party? Don’t wonder. Instead, make blindfolders
out of strips of gauze long enough to go around
one’s head. Just about where the eyes would come put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
pads of absorbent cotton, using adhesive tape to hold
them in place. These blindfolders are very inexpensive
and far more hygienic than the usual handkerchief,
and it isn’t half as easy to peek through them either!</p>


<h4>Employment Bureau.</h4>

<p>Guests are divided into two equal groups lined up
against opposite walls of the room. One side is designated
as the first to ask for employment. They go into
secret session to decide on some trade. When ready,
they advance to the middle of the room where the other
group is standing in a line waiting for them. The first
group says, “We want a job.” The others ask, “What
can you do?” Then the first group begins to act out
its trade in pantomime. For example, they have decided
to be veterinarians. Some act as horses and cows while
the others act as the doctors who examine their teeth,
their tongues, look at their heels, make them run, etc.,
etc. As soon as their opponents call out “Veterinarians!”
they break and run for their side of the room.
Any of them who are tagged before they reach the wall
go to the ranks of the enemy.</p>

<p>The other side then has its turn, and after about ten
minutes of this, announce that the next act will be the
last, and that a count will be taken to see which side
lost and which won the most members. The winners
get a double share of refreshments!</p>


<h4>Automobile.</h4>

<p>All of the guests but one are given chairs, and they
are seated informally about the room. The one who
has no chair is the assembler. To every other player
is given the name of some part of an automobile, a list<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
of which names has been prepared beforehand to avoid
the uninteresting delay that is inevitable when a hostess
has to stop to think of names to assign people. For
example, there are the radiator, the clutch, the steering
wheel, gears, speedometer, tonneau, brakes, all the different
parts of an automobile which are easy enough to
think of when one is at leisure and can sit down with
pencil and paper and work out such a list, but a slightly
different proposition when one is before a group of
guests who are waiting.</p>

<p>That list is given to the assembler and he begins his
story of a trip to the country one Sunday, a trip which
was a series of mishaps. He tells how he prepared for
the trip, bringing in the names of the various parts,
and as he calls out the various parts they “assemble”
in a line directly in back of him, with hands on the
shoulders of the one in front of them. The story goes
on, all about the accidents and hard luck of the day,
how he stripped his gears, etc., etc., until all of the parts
are assembled in line behind the assembler, when
the automobile starts running around the room, at first
slowly, but getting faster and faster until all of a sudden
the leader stops abruptly, calls out “Honk! honk!”—at
which time it is the immediate business of life to
break ranks and get a chair. There is a mad scramble
for chairs, successful for all but one.</p>

<p>This unfortunate is the assembler for the next time.
Everyone is given a different part and the game goes
on as before. At the end every effort is made to make
this assembler, who was too slow to get a chair the first
time, just as unsuccessful this time. At any rate, the
one who doesn’t get a chair is the assembler for the next
and last run, and if it has been possible to keep some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
person from getting a chair two successive times he
is obliged to pay the corner forfeit, which compels him
to cry in one corner, laugh in the next, dance in the
next, and sing Home Sweet Home in the last.</p>


<h4>Be Definite!</h4>

<p>The hostess calls out the following words and expressions,
assigning one to every guest in turn, and immediately
each one must give his definition of the word
or expression given him. The fun in this venture (and
the fun may be endless!) lies in the word given out.
For example, “Goatee.” Everybody knows what a
goatee is, but mighty few can give an intelligent definition
of it. Almost invariably the answer will be
“Oh, you know. Something that—something that—well,
you know—” and then will come the downward
stroking of the chin! But no pantomiming is allowed,
although you have said nothing about it. Anyone who
pantomimes is punished by being given an extra word,
the second, much harder than the first. The following
may be included:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Goatee.</p>

<p>2. A feeble effort.</p>

<p>3. A puff of wind.</p>

<p>4. A good impression.</p>

<p>5. An accordion.</p>

<p>6. A spiral staircase.</p>

<p>7. A deep sigh.</p>

<p>8. A mere whim.</p>
</div>


<h4>Help!</h4>

<p>Get a piece of cardboard about the size of the back
of a tablet. Tell the one at your right that he is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
take that cardboard exactly as you give it to him and
in exactly the same place, and that he will then give it
to his neighbor in the same way. Put the short side
between your nose and lip, holding it there until your
neighbor takes it from you, not with his hands, but between
his nose and lip. Even the handsomest person
in the room is a caricature when he screws down his
nose and stretches up his lip in his efforts to hold the
cardboard there until his pugnosed neighbor can overcome
his unholy laughter long enough to get his features
in the right shape to take it.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to start three or four cards at different
places in the circle.</p>


<h4>Human Adjectives.</h4>

<p>Divide the group into two equal sides. A leader is
chosen for each group.</p>

<p>Each side is to decide upon some noun that has just as
many letters in it as the team has members. Every
member is assigned a letter. He is to decide on some
adjective beginning with that letter, and he will “act
out” that adjective for the edification of the members
of the other team who are acting as audience for the
time being. It is the business of the audience to guess
what adjective is being dramatized. As soon as they
hit upon the right adjective, they take its first letter
as the first letter in the noun the team is dramatizing.
Then the next human adjective takes his turn and so on
until all the letters of the noun have been dramatized.</p>

<p>As an illustration, a team takes the noun “stone.”
There are five members in the group and five letters
in the word. The first actor has “s” for his letter.
He chooses “silly” for his adjective, and he acts as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
silly as he possibly can and continues to do so until
someone in the audience calls out the correct guess,
“You’re acting silly!” The audience has the first letter
to the word, “s.” Next comes “t.” The adjective
chosen was “tired.” Then “o”—ornery; next “n”—noisy;
and last “e”—empty. Taking the first letters
of these adjectives in turn, the audience has the word
“stone.”</p>

<p>Then the opposing team acts out adjectives describing
the first letters of its noun, and so they take turn
about, and if real snap and enthusiasm are put into the
acting out of the adjectives this can be the game of the
evening as far as genuine and sideach-y fun is concerned.
Can’t you just see the minister of the Baptist Church
acting “ornery,” pushing people about, twitching
Beacon Jones’ nose, pulling Susie’s hair and in general,
making himself an unmitigated nuisance and showing
up a truly ornery disposition?</p>

<p>It is surprising always to find how many people enjoy
acting ornery, and noisy, and silly, and all the other
forbidden adjectives!</p>


<h4>Parlor Slapjack.</h4>

<p>Guests are standing in a circle, hands outstretched
behind them. The one who is “It” walks around the
outside of the circle, suddenly slaps an outstretched
hand and, without stopping an instant, continues to
walk around the circle in the direction he was going.
The one whose hand was slapped immediately starts
walking in the opposite direction, the objective for both
walkers being the place that was just vacated. It belongs
to the one who reaches it first, while the other becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
“It.” They are to walk only. No running is
allowed.</p>

<p>But—certain rites must be performed before either
one may take the place in the circle. “It” and the one
whose hand was slapped are bound to meet on their
way round the circle. When they do, “It” does whatever
he wishes in the way of a stunt, and the other must
imitate exactly before they may continue their race
for the empty place. The following stunts are very
good because of their esthetic value:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Make a deep bow.</p>

<p>2. Shake hands.</p>

<p>3. Sing up the scale.</p>

<p>4. Make an awful face.</p>

<p>5. Hop the rest of the way with one foot.</p>

<p>6. Run with hands waving in a flying motion.</p>
</div>


<h4>Boast!</h4>

<p>All guests are seated and are roughly divided into two
groups. A representative is chosen from each side.
Each one is to proclaim the merits of the members of
his group. The only drawback is that they are to do
it at the same time. Impartial judges are chosen, and
they are to base their judgment on delivery, continuity
of thought, and last, but most important, on truth!
The speakers face the audience, and at a signal, start
to speak at the same time, each one trying his best to
drown out the other.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that it is a comparatively
simple matter to speak intelligently and logically, and
at the same time to speak as loudly as you can, especially
when a rival is doing all these things at the same
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span></p>


<h4>A Mixup.</h4>

<p>Two slips of paper are given each one, together with
the request that a perfectly good question be written
on one, and a perfectly good answer to it on the other.
All questions and answers are gathered, the questions
in one box and the answers in another. They are
thoroughly mixed and then passed around, each one
taking both a question and an answer. They are called
on in turn to read their slips, and some of them are
slips to be sure! At one party one of the men drew,
“What did you do last Saturday?” and the answer was,
“A permanent wave, a henna rinse, and a facial!”</p>


<h4>Flattery.</h4>

<p>Each guest writes his initials on the top of a piece of
paper. These papers are collected, mixed up, and then
passed around again. Players are to use the initials
on their slips in writing out the most unctuous words
of flattery they can think of about the owner of the
initials, every word they use, however, having to start
with the initials on the paper. The results are startling!</p>

<p>The papers are again collected and at refreshment
time are passed out to their rightful owners to be read
aloud.</p>


<h4>Amateur Vaudeville.</h4>

<p>The names of very well-known popular songs are
written out on separate slips of paper. One of these
slips is pinned on each guest as he comes in. Instead
of greeting each other as usual, they are to shake hands
with everyone and without saying a word in greeting,
are to sing the song with which they are labelled. Anyone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
who is caught talking instead of singing his song
is required to sing it alone before the group.</p>

<p>May the leader have mercy on her guests and not
keep up this gentle game of greeting for more than four
or five minutes!</p>


<h4>Progressive Nonsense.</h4>

<p>Tables are arranged as for any progressive game, the
winning two advancing to the next table. Guests are
in couples, two couples to a table. At table No. 1 the
ladies are to compete in doing a sum in arithmetic,
while the men’s contest centers around three buttons
which are to be sewed on a piece of cloth.</p>

<p>At table No. 2 the ladies darn a sock with their left
hands, while the men compete in paring one large potato
apiece.</p>

<p>At table No. 3 the men write out a recipe for mince
pie, while the ladies write a fifty-word essay on politics,
which they must read aloud to the judges.</p>

<p>At table No. 4 the ladies tie their partners ties, the
hostess acting as judge, while the men darn socks.</p>

<p>Further competitions may center about the following
events:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>For the Ladies.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>1. Write a four-line limerick.</p>

<p>2. Write out your version of baseball and read it
aloud.</p>

<p>3. Drive ten nails in a board.</p>
</div>
<p><i>For the Men.</i></p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>1. Make a complete menu.</p>

<p>2. Embroider a very simple design on a doily.</p>

<p>3. Trim a hat and wear it the rest of the evening.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>Almost any of these events may serve as separate
contests, rather than as events in a progressive game.</p>


<h4>Trades.</h4>

<p>Each one chooses a trade for himself, the action of
which he is to pantomime when the person who has been
sent out of the room is called back in. This person is
to guess what trades are being represented, and the first
one whose trade she guesses correctly is the one to go
out the next time.</p>

<p>At the entrance of this one, who has been outside the
room, all begin pantomiming their trades at the same
time. No one is to tell anyone else what trade he has
chosen so that the same trade can be used over and over
until it is guessed.</p>


<h4>Transitions.</h4>

<p>A very good quiet game for small groups is one in
which transitions between words are made. For example,
let the word “ship” be the starting word.
From ship we wish to evolve the word “boat,” changing
only one letter at a time. The transition might be
as follows: Ship, shop, shot, soot, boot, boat.</p>

<p>Other very simple ones are the transitions between
man and boy, boot and shoe, bed and cot, hog and pig,
fun and joy, dry and wet.</p>


<h4>Initials.</h4>

<p>Each guest is given a sheet of paper and a pencil.
He is to answer the questions written out on the paper,
using only such words in his answers as begin with his
initials. After about five minutes the papers are collected,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
mixed up and passed around again, and each one
in turn is to read the paper he holds.</p>

<p>The questions run as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. What is your name?</p>

<p>2. Your occupation?</p>

<p>3. Your favorite pastime?</p>

<p>4. Your favorite food?</p>

<p>5. Your favorite color?</p>

<p>6. The thing you most abhor?</p>

<p>7. Your best feature?</p>

<p>8. Your one pride?</p>

<p>9. Your one embarrassment?</p>

<p>10. What do you long to be?</p>
</div>

<p>Typical answers are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Charles Berner.</p>

<p>2. Combing beaches.</p>

<p>3. Caddying blithely.</p>

<p>4. Corn bisque.</p>

<p>5. Corn blue.</p>

<p>6. Cootie bites.</p>

<p>7. Cute bones.</p>

<p>8. Cunning baby.</p>

<p>9. Cracked bridge.</p>

<p>10. Colossal boob.</p>
</div>


<h4>Stunts.</h4>

<p>The group is divided into two sides. Both sides take
a few minutes to see what resources they have in the
way of stunts. They then throw up a coin to see which
side is to perform first. The side which wins, that is,
does not have to perform until the other side has given
its stunt, starts to count slowly, “1, 2, 3, 4, 5,” and so
on up to ten. If some member of the other side has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
not started to give a stunt by the time they count to
ten, one point is gained by the counting side. If someone
has started to perform however, they are to stop
counting the minute the stunt begins.</p>

<p>Then their turn to put on a stunt comes, and the
other side starts to count to ten. If they fail to have
a stunt ready before “ten,” they lose a point to the
other side.</p>

<p>There is always an intermission of one minute after
a stunt has been completed, to give the opposite side
that long to get a stunt ready. The stunts may include
any possible kind of entertainment, from doing an
esthetic dance to “speaking a piece” or a funny story.
After ten minutes of this, the side that has the most
points gets the most refreshments.</p>

<h3><i>Games for Large Groups.</i></h3>

<h4>The Changeable Grand March.</h4>

<p>There is nothing more valuable than the Grand
March for a group of guests who don’t know each other
and who have very little in common (as yet!). Just the
ordinary Grand March will not do at all. It must be
a grand Grand March, one which will thaw out every
particle of ice, one which will cause the kind of laughter
that creates that wonderful feeling of fellowship
and friendliness. With that feeling once created you
have nothing to fear for the success of your evening.</p>

<p>Guests are lined up in two lines, men in one, ladies
in the other. There is something so blessedly impersonal
about the Grand March in which no one, however
bashful and embarrassed, is an individual but rather
just a part of a long line, that you can almost invariably
get every person present to “step into line.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Don’t make the mistake then of asking them to take
partners. Rather, have the men march to the right
and girls to the left, meet at the back of the room and
come marching up the middle of the room with partners.
That saves endless embarrassment and confusion.</p>

<p>The fun is on! Ladies take their partner’s arm, and
the leading couple starts the line of march around the
room. They are to start it with a walk, but suddenly
the whistle will blow, and without stopping, they are
to change their method of locomotion to the one called
out by the leader. For example, they are walking
along quietly and peacefully when the leader’s whistle
blows and she calls out “Hippity-hop,” and they all
hippity-hop. Next comes the order, “Fly like birds!”
and away they all go, waving their arms like birds flying,
and running on tiptoe. Then reverse and walk;
walk forward on tiptoes.</p>

<p>Other directions may include orders to walk with
eyes shut; reverse and limp every other step; walk and
clap hands; stoop every other step; toe out; on heels;
on one foot; get a new partner any place; walk and
sing any song that no one else is singing; toe in; walk
backwards taking large steps; forward and hum; whirl
arms in circles; swim; keep feet together and hop like
a toad; flap arms to the side and crow like a rooster;
bend forward and swing heads from side to side; clap
hands, first over head, and then behind back; whistle
whether you can or not, and so on, changing the directions
quickly and unexpectedly and in a good-natured
way demanding immediate and accurate response.
You’ll never get it.</p>

<p>It is not wise to continue this for longer than three
or four minutes, or to give more than eight or nine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
changes. Your group will agree with you that that
will be quite enough!</p>


<h4>The Treasure Hunt Grand March.</h4>

<p>Hide peanuts or small favors or covered candies in
every conceivable spot. Guests are lined up with partners
as if for a Grand March. The line of march is
around the room without coming up the middle. When
the music begins leaders start marching. Suddenly the
director’s whistle sounds as the signal that the hunt is
on. They break ranks and scramble to find the hidden
peanuts. Two whistles sound sharply, the signal to discontinue
the search at once, find your partner and get
into the line of march, which is straggly and uneven
at best, but it makes no difference as long as everyone
is in it and no one is hunting peanuts. The music and
marching continue until another single whistle proclaims
an open season for peanuts, the last one.</p>

<p>At the double whistle they continue their marching
as before except that the leaders bring the line down
the center, and all halt while the director finds out who
didn’t get any peanuts and who got the most.</p>

<p>The winner is called out, stationed in front of the
line, and they are all obliged to pass by him and give
him all their peanuts. They do this with weeping and
wailing until they hear your announcement at the end
that as a punishment for his greediness he in turn is
to give up all his peanuts to the unfortunates who
didn’t get any!</p>


<h4>The Harmonious Hunt.</h4>

<p>Are you looking for the kind of game that leaves
guests exhausted with that comfortable exhaustion that
comes from helpless laughter?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>Divide your group into teams, each team having a
captain and an individual team call. Calls may be
braying like a donkey; mooing like a cow; cock-a-doodle-doo-ing;
whistling; cat-calling; meowing; barking;
quacking; baa-ing; gobble-gobbling; or imitating
sounds of instruments like the drum, rubba-dubb-dubb;
the piccolo, tweedle-deedle-dee; the trombone, boom-boom-boom;
the triangle, knick-knock-knock; the mandolin,
plank-plank-plank; the cymbal, zum-zum-zum; the
accordion, yea-yea-yea, in each case pantomiming the
action as well as imitating the sound. The action for
the accordion inflicts real punishment on its imitators.
Arms are bent upward and elbows are thrust out sideways
and drawn in rapidly. This is particularly good
for stout people.</p>

<p>Each team is assigned one of these calls and must
use only that way of calling to the team captain. Peanuts
or candy or favors are hidden in every conceivable
spot. When the signal is given the hunt is on. No
one, however, except a captain, is allowed to touch a
peanut. That is the reason for the call. As soon as a
person finds a peanut he stands beside it and sends out
an S. O. S. for his captain, using his team call as the
signal for help. The captain answers each call by running
to the spot and picking up the peanut. After a
definite length of time the closing signal is given and
the hunt is over. Each captain counts his find, and the
losing teams must give up all their peanuts to be divided
equally among the winners in spite of inevitable protests.</p>

<p>This game may be used for either indoor or out-of-door
parties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span></p>


<h4>The Inverted Spell-Down.</h4>

<p>The formation for this game is two lines facing, partners
side by side, twenty-six in each line. Two sets of
alphabet letters, one set red and the other black, are
given out, one to each line. In playing this with a
small group where there are not enough guests to have
twenty-six in each line, two or even three letters may
be given to one person, those holding “unpopular” consonants
like X. Y. Z. Q., etc., being given the extra letters.
The leader calls out words, necessarily easy ones,
and those from each group holding the letters making
up that word must run to the appointed place and form
the word, each one holding his letter high and facing
the judges. The only rule to be observed in the spelling
is that each word be spelled backwards. For example,
kitty is not spelt k-i-t-t-y, but y-t-t-i-k! If a
letter is used twice in a word the one holding that letter
must go first to one place and then to the other.
For example, in excel, e takes his place before x and
then runs over to the place between c and l. In case
of a double letter the letter is simply jiggled back and
forth.</p>

<p>The place to stand in spelling a word should be
chosen with the audience in mind. If the two lines are
standing lengthwise in the room those forming a word
should be at one end of the room and the judges and any
audience at the other. In that way everyone can see.
Those holding red letters when forming their words
stand close to the red side, while those holding black
letters stand close to the black. In this way one avoids
having one color standing in front of the other.</p>

<p>The judges decide which side forms the word first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
and the score is kept and announced before each new
word.</p>

<p>The time limit is left to the leader who tries within
a reasonable time to run up a tie score, when, of course,
interest is at its highest point. Then the announcement
that the next point is the deciding one naturally creates
a real tension which is hardly relieved when the leader
calls out something like Mississippi or Pennsylvania for
the last word!</p>


<h4>Street and Alley.</h4>

<p>Use a march to get your guests into lines, eight
abreast, with enough room between the lines for passing.
Lines must be straight. At a whistle from the
leader each one is to make a quick quarter turn to the
right, immediately joining hands with his new neighbors.
Another whistle means another quarter turn to
the right again joining hands with neighbors at once.
Each whistle calls for a turn to the right and a joining
of hands with one’s new neighbors. It is a good plan
to let them practice the response to the whistle before
the game itself begins.</p>

<p>When ready to begin, the lines face the front of the
room. A policeman and a thief are chosen, a man for
the policeman and a woman for the thief. The thief
is given a very short start, and at a signal the policeman
starts after her, chasing her in and out of the
passageways or “streets” made by the lines of guests.
Suddenly the whistle blows. Everyone takes a quick
turn to the right, and new passageways or “alleys” are
formed, with the policeman still doing his best to catch
the elusive thief. Neither policeman or thief is allowed
to break through a line or dodge under it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>The leader watches the chase very closely and blows
his whistle at very short intervals, changing streets to
alleys and alleys to streets, in some cases to help the
thief escape and in others to help the policeman catch
her. A good part of the fun of the game depends on
the leader’s blowing her whistle at critical moments.
When a thief is caught, the leader, who had already in
her mind chosen a new policeman and thief, names
these victims and they change places with the first
policeman and thief.</p>

<p>Men almost always run faster than women, so it is a
good plan to choose stout policemen and lively thieves.</p>


<h3><i>Games for Either Large or Small Groups.</i></h3>


<h4>Musical Ruth and Jacob.</h4>

<p>This is particularly for a group of guests who could
in no sense be called musical. The guests are standing
in a circle with a man and a girl in the center. If the
group is large, have them crowd in to make the circle
space smaller so that it will not make Jacob’s work too
difficult. The game is played like the old-fashioned
“Ruth and Jacob,” both of them being blindfolded, it
being the task of Jacob to catch Ruth. Instead of calling
“Ruth,” however, Jacob sings up the scale, whether
he can or not, and Ruth answers by singing down the
scale, both of them using “Loo” instead of do-re-mi.</p>

<p>The game is infinitely more ridiculous if neither one
can sing, and if the leader has created the right atmosphere,
even though a man protests, “I just <i>can’t</i> sing,”
he will usually finish up by making a noble effort to do
it anyhow!</p>

<p>When Jacob catches Ruth, the leader, who has in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
meantime been looking over the circle, immediately announces
the next two victims and almost invariably
public opinion will be with her to such an extent that
they step forth, willy-nilly.</p>


<h4>Mimic.</h4>

<p>If there are more than fifteen or twenty guests, choose
about six men and six girls to form the circle. Even
“Mimic” becomes monotonous in a large circle. Those
forming the circle are seated, men beside their partners,
the leader taking the part of one of the girls. She begins
the action by doing something to the man at her
right who in turn must mimic her action exactly to the
girl to his right, and so the action goes all around the
circle till it comes back to the leader who starts a new
one. This may continue for about four or five rounds,
and can be made the best game of the evening if the
leader has planned sufficiently diabolical actions. For
example, her first might be to do a funny step in front
of him, at the time tra-la-la-la-ing in a high key. Her
right-hand neighbor must imitate her to the very best
of his ability. Her next action might be to sing up the
scale to the highest note she can reach; next, she might
cry as realistically as possible; and then laugh as musically
as she can!</p>


<h4>Shun the Circle.</h4>

<p>Guests form a large circle, the men on the right side
of their partners, all of them faced for marching. Four
or more circles about four feet in diameter have been
roughly drawn in chalk on the floor. The distance between
them depends on the size of the circle formed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
the group. When the music starts, everyone begins to
march around in circle formation with the one rule that
everyone must walk straight across each of the small
circles described on the floor. Suddenly the leader’s
whistle blows, the music stops, all movement halts, and
anyone caught in any of the small circles is discarded.
If the leader has a watchful eye she can blow the whistle
at a bad time and make it mighty uncomfortable for
some couple, just poised, to take the first step into one
of the circles, or another couple just on the outer edge
of the danger zone. The precarious balancing in either
case is choice!</p>

<p>This continues at the leader’s discretion. Almost
never is it advisable to carry it through till the last
couple is caught.</p>


<h4>Friendliness.</h4>

<p>Men are in one line, girls in another. It is the object
of the girls to be so friendly that the men, who are perfect
glooms, cannot help smiling. The girls may laugh
or giggle or smirk or make faces in their efforts to break
the gloom that seems to be holding the men. Any man
who forgets his manliness to the extent of smiling, even
the least little bit, goes over to the side of the ladies.
At the end of the three-minute time limit, all the men
whose gloom has not been broken and who confidently
wait for the prize they think forthcoming, are fined ten
cents for being killjoys.</p>

<p>Another friendly effort is the revised version of the
popular song “Smiles.” At first it is sung correctly,
but the next time the word “smile” is omitted, and in
its place, each singer smiles his sweetest possible smile
at his neighbor. It is painful!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>


<h4>A Chinese Spell-Down.</h4>

<p>The idea is like that of a regular spelling-match with
two sides competing, except that words must be spelled
backwards. The time given each person to reverse his
spelling and think the word backwards is decidedly
limited, according to the leader, who makes a pretense
of timing each one. Instead of discarding those whose
tongues and brains could not reverse, a score is kept of
each error, and the score announced as each new word
is given out. This will create a healthy competition,
and if the leader will hint that the winning side will be
favored at refreshment time such a hint usually acts
as a powerful mental stimulant.</p>

<p>The time limit is left to the leader who tries within a
reasonable time to run up a tie score, when, of course,
interest is at its highest point. Then the announcement
that the next point is the deciding one naturally creates
a real tension which is hardly relieved when the leader
announces the word “Hippopotamus!”</p>


<h4>Dodge!</h4>

<p>All guests are in a circle. Count off by twos. All
No. 1’s go into the center of the circle. Three or more
beanbags are passed out to No. 2’s who form the circle.
At a signal they start to toss the bags at the ones who
are in the center, no one being allowed to leave his place
to get a better aim. It is the big business of life for
those in the center to avoid the beanbags tossed at them,
for anyone who is hit must get out of the center and
take his former place in the circle. If a beanbag is
caught it does not count as a hit.</p>

<p>When all No. 1’s have been hit, No. 2’s go into the center
and take their turn acting as targets, while No. 1’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
aim at them with the beanbags. When they have all
been driven out of the circle, the last No. 1 and the last
No. 2 to be hit by a beanbag go into the center and become
targets. The one who stays in the longest without
getting hit gets a prize, a bean.</p>


<h4>Extry!</h4>

<p>Ask your guests to line up in two lines, men in one
and girls in the other, to march down opposite sides of
the room to the back, meet their partners there and come
marching up the center. As they pass the leader and
her assistant, each one is handed a newspaper and a
small strip of pins, after which they are to march to
the back of the room. When everyone has been supplied
with newspapers and pins the leader announces
that partners will help each other make costumes out
of the papers, and that the only requirement is that all
costumes must definitely represent some character of
history, or fiction, or popular interest, or be patterned
after the mode of dress in some country.</p>

<p>Sounds impossible? You will find that there will be
at least fifteen Hawaiians, eight Santa Clauses, nine
babies, five Mary Pickfords with newspapery curly hair,
seven Topsys and eleven Charlie Chaplins! Several
pairs of scissors are available, and the hats from the
cloakroom may be used. A period of twenty minutes is
given for dress-making, which means working at top
speed. At the end of that time there is a Grand March
past the judges, and after everyone has passed the reviewing
stand, the line is halted at the back of the room.
Then the first couple is announced by the leader,
“Punch and Judy,” and they walk slowly up the room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
past the judges. The second couple is then announced,
as is each couple, with not too great an interval between
couples so that monotony may be avoided. Prizes are
given the most hideous, the most beautiful, the best
made and the poorest made costumes, judges being
careful to choose the costume made by some well-known,
good-natured person for this last prize. The prizes,
which are presented with much ceremony, range from
a paper of pins to a week-old newspaper.</p>


<h4>The Hunting Ground.</h4>

<p>If tables the size of an ordinary kitchen table are procurable,
and are placed end to end, they make an admirable
hunting ground. However, chairs can be used if
they are arranged so that they cover about the same
space that the tables would, the seats turned in. A
man and a girl are placed at diagonally opposite corners
of this territory, both are blindfolded, and at a signal
must begin to go around this unknown country, their
only guide being the table on which they must keep
their hands. It is the business of the man to catch the
girl, whose aim in life, however, is to frustrate his plans.
As both are holding on to the edges of the tables, feeling
their way around it, and both are moving as quietly as
possible in order to hear any movement of the other, it
is inevitable that the girl in her stealthy efforts to evade
her pursuer will eventually walk straight into his groping
hands! When she is caught another man and a girl
are chosen, with perhaps one more couple to follow them.
If the audience is given strict orders to keep absolutely
quiet and to refrain from all laughter, it makes for a
ridiculous situation!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span></p>


<h4>Laughter!</h4>

<p>Does it seem stupid to exact forfeits of people who
were unfortunate in a game that demanded skill or
speed or ingenuity? That all depends on the forfeit.
Four or five men, who are the left-overs in a game which
provides the chance to get a partner, can be made to
pay a forfeit that is a real one! These left-overs are
lined up in a row facing all the other guests. They are
told that they are to be given a chance to vindicate themselves
in a try-out of a particular talent. The first test
is as to the musical quality of each one’s laugh. Each
in turn laughs for the audience in as musical a tone as
he can muster up. The audience votes for the best.
Next, each in turn must laugh as long as he can without
taking a breath. The next test is for shrillness; the
next for the heartiest laugh, and the last for the most
contagious laugh!</p>


<h4>The Quizz.</h4>

<p>Some five or six people are chosen for the class which
is to be quizzed. The teacher has her back to the guests,
and her class faces them. She has prepared a list of
questions which she puts to different members of her
class, pointing to one of them at a time. All other
guests are to act as judges, and as a question is answered
they call out either “Right” or “Wrong.” The faction
that shouts the loudest gets a verdict. A scorekeeper
keeps a bogus score of points made by each member of
the class, and at the end the prize is given to the one
who made the poorest showing, although all through
the quizz much ado is made about how close the score
is between different members of the class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>The questions in the quizz can be on any subject under
the sun, and the more impossible the better, for
every member of the class must give some answer to the
question put to him. “I don’t know” is not allowed
under any circumstances. The following set of questions
is typical:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Where do we get kerosene?</p>

<p>2. Who is the best looking man (or woman) present?</p>

<p>3. What man in this room is a model husband?</p>

<p>4. Who wrote Gray’s Elegy?</p>
</div>


<h4>Hear! Hear!</h4>

<p>This may be used as a penalty, but it is always wise
to choose your victim with care. This victim is asked
to stand before the other guests and then told to make
a speech on some subject in which you are sure both he
and the audience are very much interested. But—he
is to take the opposition. For example, if he is a
staunch Republican and most of the guests are Republican
in sympathy ask him to say the harshest things
he can think of about the Republican party. Or if he
happens to be the Baptist minister, ask him to denounce
the church; or if he is a man who is constantly boring
his friends with tales of the wondrous deeds of his
children, ask him to speak on “The Despair of My Life,
My Children.”</p>

<p>The speaker is to pause after each statement, and
everyone present must applaud loudly and call out
“Hear! hear!” Anyone who neglects this little ceremony
is in danger. The leader acts as monitor and announces
that anyone whose applause is found to be unsatisfactory
is liable to be the next one to be asked to
make a speech. Here again the leader uses her judgment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
and cuts off the speaker just at the right time,
calling for anyone she chooses as the next speaker,
disregarding his assurance that he clapped hard!</p>

<p>With some groups it is mighty successful to use more
personal subjects. For example, at a Methodist church
party a man might be asked to speak on “Why the Baptist
women are so much better looking than our Methodist
women,” and the unfortunate Methodist ladies
who would like to tar and feather him must clap their
hands loudly and call out “Hear! hear!” In spite of
their wrath, most of them remember to applaud, but
Miss Brownleigh in the front row is laughing so hard,
and is so busy shaking her fist at the speaker that she
forgets all about her obligations and up on the platform
she goes as the next speaker!</p>


<h4>Scramble.</h4>

<p>Ask everyone to bring his chair nearer to the center,
to make a circle. Remove four or five chairs, the number
depending on the size of the group, asking their
previous tenants to come to the center of the circle.
When the march time music begins, everyone must get
up and start marching around to the right, those who
are without chairs joining the line of march, no one
touching a chair till the leader’s whistle blows and the
music stops. Then it is up to everyone to get a chair
or go into the middle of the circle. This is continued
for four or five rounds.</p>

<p>Then the leader asks them to hippity-hop instead of
march, at the leader’s whistle scrambling for a chair as
usual. After three or four rounds of hippity-hopping
they are to walk backwards instead, and for the last
few rounds, they are to hop on one foot, and woe be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
unto those who are left in the middle at the end! Warn
them of this, promising dire punishment, just before
the last round, and you will have the funniest situation
of the evening.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br>

<small>RACES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>While big group games, which take in everyone, are
splendid in promoting sociability and group spirit,
nevertheless it is unwise to keep guests going at too
strenuous a pace. The first result is a dropping out of
participants and the next a growing lack of interest,
which finally develops into an irritability that plays
havoc with any spirit of play. On the other hand, it
is almost as bad to ask guests to “just sit” and rest,
thereby letting all the interest a leader has awakened
die an early and natural death. Instead, it has proved
very effective to have races, contests, stunts and trick
games at this time, events that will keep up interest, but
which will need only a few participants. The following
chapter on “Races” was written for that purpose, to
provide those very necessary fill-ins.</p>


<h4>Kiddy Kar Race.</h4>

<p>The course should be about thirty feet in length.
The biggest men present are chosen for drivers, and
there are two drivers for each team.</p>

<p>The Kiddy Kars are lined up at the starting point,
with driver No. 1 sitting on the car, all set to go. At
the whistle they are off, the cars propelled in the usual
and only possible fashion! They travel to the goal
about thirty feet away and return, immediately turning
over their cars to the other member of the team, driver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
No. 2, who starts off without waiting for any signal, to
run the same course. The one who is first to return to
the starting place wins the race for his team.</p>

<p>The possibilities of a Kiddy Kar made for a five-year-old,
but propelled by a forty-five-year-old are almost
unbelievable.</p>


<h4>The Reducer.</h4>

<p>Eight men are chosen to run this race, four in each
line, one behind the other. The first one in each line
has a barrel hoop bound about with cloth so that no
ragged edges are left to penetrate the reducee. At a
signal from the leader the first man of each line runs
up to the goal line, which is across the middle of the
room, puts the hoop above his head and quickly draws
it down over his shoulders to the floor, steps out of it,
picks it up, runs back and gives it to the next runner,
he himself going to the end of the line. The second
runner does the same thing and so does the third, and
then the fourth runner who first gets through the hoop
and back to his place wins the race for his team.</p>

<p>No matter how stout the men of a group are, it always
seems possible for them to get through their hoops.
At innumerable social events I have looked for a fat
guest to get jammed in his hoop, but as yet I have been
disappointed.</p>


<h4>Hippity-Hop Potato Race.</h4>

<p>There are four couples in this effort, for effort it is.
They form two teams, two couples in each team, one
couple standing behind the other. Both the man and
the lady of the first couple in each team are given a
teaspoon with a large potato in it. At a signal from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
leader these two first couples hurry down the room to
the goal line, and return to give the spoons and the
potatoes to the second couples of their teams.</p>

<p>There are two regulations, however, which make it
not so easy as it might appear. Every lady takes her
partner’s arm and keeps it through the entire race.
Under no condition is she to let go. If a contestant
should drop his potato, his partner must still keep his
arm while he stoops to pick it up. The other regulation
is that instead of running or walking to the goal
they are to hop on one foot all the way.</p>


<h4>Partnership Relay.</h4>

<p>Six or eight couples are placed in groups of two
couples each, one couple standing behind the other, the
entire group about twenty feet from a goal line. The
girls take their partners’ arms and retain possession
throughout each event despite the inevitable protest at
lagging. At a signal, each first couple walks to the
goal line, carrying out directions given before each
event of the relay; then hurries back and touches off
the second couple. Events might be as follows:</p>

<p>1. Each man carries a glass full of water. At the
goal he hands it to the girl who must drink it all before
they can rush back to the starting point.</p>

<p>2. Together they clap hands and sing Yankee Doodle
as they walk to the goal and back.</p>

<p>3. Each man has a cracker. At the goal he gives it
to his partner, who must eat it, and is not allowed to
start back until she can whistle.</p>

<p>4. At the goal line the man sings up the scale and
waits for the girl to sing down the scale before they can
go back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>5. While they are hurrying to the goal line the leader
may blow her whistle at any time, which is the signal
for them to turn completely around once, and then continue
their course. Because their arms are locked and
because they always have different ideas about the right
way to turn, complications arise!</p>


<h4>Balloons.</h4>

<p>Choose four teams, with two on each team. Each
couple is given a toy balloon, the kind that is blown up
by the leader beforehand, with a rubber band attached
to keep the air in. At a signal from the leader partners
link arms and, with their free hands, start batting
the balloons down the length of the room and return,
using the open hand in batting.</p>

<p>No matter what happens to the balloon they are to
keep their arms linked. A balloon is so very dependable
in its actions that it is a simple matter for two people
of different minds to make it take a straight and narrow
path!</p>


<h4>Stepping Stones.</h4>

<p>Two couples compete against each other. The man
of each couple is given two folded newspapers, one for
each hand. At the signal for starting he quickly puts
one of the papers down and the lady steps on it with
her right foot. He then puts down the other paper a
little distance ahead, and she steps on it with her left
foot. He puts the first paper as far forward as he
thinks she can step, and she puts her right foot on it.
Then the left, the right, etc., etc., the object being to
reach the goal, some thirty feet away, before the other
couple can reach it, the only rule being that the lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
must walk on newspapers only, which her partner
places for her.</p>

<p>Said partners are always too ambitious in setting out
the papers, and it takes considerable stepping to bridge
the gaps.</p>


<h4>Helpless Eating.</h4>

<p>Each contestant is given a large cracker. She is to
place it in her mouth, put her hands behind her, and
at a signal, start to eat the cracker with no help from
her hands. The one who whistles first after eating her
cracker gets a good big prize.</p>


<h4>Air!</h4>

<p>Contestants are lined up facing the crowd. If they
can whistle it is infinitely funnier to use the whistling
contest. If they cannot whistle let them sing a high
note. In either case, at a signal, they start to whistle
or sing, and the one who can hold her note the longest
without taking another breath gets a toy balloon as a
prize.</p>


<h4>Lemon!</h4>

<p>Contestants are provided with a lemon and a lead
pencil. They are to roll the lemon with the lead pencil
at least fifty feet and return. The one who gets his
lemon back first gets the lemon.</p>


<h4>Nose Power.</h4>

<p>A piece of wrapping paper about two yards long is
placed before each contestant. A penny is placed on
one end of it. Each contestant kneels down before his
penny, and at a signal starts to push the penny down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
the paper, using, not his hands, but his nose as the motive
power. The one who first gets his penny down the
length of the paper gets all the pennies, and our sympathy.</p>


<h4>The Variety Store.</h4>

<p>Guests line up in two equal lines, men in one, women
in another, all of them facing the center. On a little
table at the head of each line there is a choice collection
of objects which are awkward to handle, the objects on
the two tables being exactly alike of course. The
leader is standing at one of the tables, with an assistant
at the other. When the lines are ready these two
leaders begin passing objects down the line. As they
reach the end of the line they are put on the floor.
When all of them have been passed the lines quickly
turn around and face the other way, and begin passing
the things back again, to see which line can first get all
of them back on the table.</p>

<p>The fun in this race lies in the nature of the objects
chosen. The following list has been used to good (or
evil) advantage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Old-fashioned flatiron.</p>

<p>2. Tin pail.</p>

<p>3. Curling iron.</p>

<p>4. Coffee pot.</p>

<p>5. Fan.</p>

<p>6. Rubber ball.</p>

<p>7. Toy engine.</p>

<p>8. Big potato.</p>

<p>9. Egg.</p>

<p>10. Hair receiver.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span></p>


<h4>The Elusive Goal.</h4>

<p>There are two men and one girl to each team, the
men being the horses and the girl their driver. The
horses stand side by side, their “inside” hands joined.
The driver stands behind them, and their “outside”
hands are held by her as reins. It is emphasized that
no matter what happens they are to keep each other’s
hands. All the teams are lined up at the starting line,
with the horses facing the goal. All contestants are
then blindfolded, horses and drivers alike. They are
all turned completely around three times, and at a signal
they start running to the goal, fifty feet away.
They need not return to the starting point. It would
be quite useless to ask them to do so. Try to realize
the difficulties of three people bound together, all of
them blindfolded, all of them hurrying, and all of them
having different ideas as to the place to which to hurry.</p>


<h4>Capable Women.</h4>

<p>Each man contestant is asked to choose the most capable
looking lady present. The ladies chosen line up at
one end of an open space and the men at the other. At
a signal the men are asked to take off their neckties,
run over to their partners, hand them the ties, and ask
them to put them back on again just as they were, with
no assistance from the men themselves. As soon as the
ties are on the men rush back to the starting point, and
the one who arrives first with the best tied tie gets one
ice-cream cone, which he must share with his capable
partner.</p>


<h4>Second Childhood.</h4>

<p>The two contestants are seated in chairs facing each
other, all the others in a circle around them. Each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
contestant has a baby’s bottle, half full of milk. The
necessary apparatus caps the bottle. One “apparatus,”
however, has a large hole punched in it. At a
signal they start in to drink the milk in approved
fashion, to see which of the two can first empty his
bottle. The one who has the tampered-with apparatus
will probably be successful, and will certainly express
great surprise at the ease which he revives a lost art.</p>


<h4>The Lamplighter.</h4>

<p>Two gallon jars, two candles, and any number of
matches are necessary. The two contestants represent
opposite factions in the group. Each one is given a
jar, the candle and several matches, is told to sit on the
jar with the right heel on the ground and the left heel
resting on the right toe. He is to hold the candle in
one hand, a match in the other, and is to light the
candle without changing the position of the feet.</p>

<p>Before you scoff at them for being so slow, try it yourself.</p>


<h4>Feathers.</h4>

<p>Contestants are lined up at the starting line, each one
provided with a plate on which there has been placed
a handful of feathers kept in place by a saucer. At a
signal they take the saucer off the feathers and start
walking as fast as they dare the length of the course,
some fifty feet, and return. Anyone who loses a feather
must stop to pick it up and put it back on the plate.</p>

<p>A draughty hall is always a favorable setting for the
feather race. Even on calm days, however, it is not an
unheard of thing for someone on the sidelines, who is
near a plate of feathers, to exhale rather strenuously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span></p>


<h4>Whoops!</h4>

<p>Each contestant is provided with a large hoop and a
small stick. The goal is pointed out to them, the goal
being a chair about fifty feet away from the starting
point. They are to roll their hoops up to and around
the chair and back. Stout ladies should be used for
contestants.</p>


<h4>Eating under Difficulties.</h4>

<p>Two apples are placed on newspapers at opposite
sides of a chair. The two contestants get down on their
knees, put their hands behind them, and at a signal
start eating the apples without any help from their
hands to see which can first eat the entire apple.</p>

<p>It really can be done!</p>


<h4>The Circus.</h4>

<p>Again use four teams with two contestants on a team.
There are several events in this race, so a score is kept
of each event.</p>

<p>Events are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Walk to goal and return, walking like mamma and
papa going to the circus.</p>

<p>2. Hippity-hop like the clown.</p>

<p>3. Be the contortionist, hopping like a frog, both feet
together.</p>

<p>4. Step high like a circus horse.</p>

<p>5. Trot like the ponies.</p>

<p>6. Lumber along with head down, swinging it like an
elephant’s trunk.</p>

<p>7. Hop on one foot like a stork.</p>

<p>8. Flap wings and crew like the rooster which got
in by mistake.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<p>The two members of each team go through each event
as partners, arms linked whenever possible.</p>


<h4>Far Far Away!</h4>

<p>Four courses are laid out by means of white strings
which are placed on the floor the full length of the
course. Each of the four contestants is given a pair of
opera glasses. At a signal he puts the large end to his
eyes and starts down the course.</p>

<p>If you think it a simple matter, try it.</p>


<h4>The Count.</h4>

<p>Contestants are lined up facing the other guests, and
are told to take a long breath and hold it. At a signal
they are to start to count aloud, all of them starting at
the same time, and not to stop until they simply cannot
count another count without taking another breath.
The one who proves that she has the greatest lung capacity
gets a toy whistle.</p>


<h4>Fruit Bearers.</h4>

<p>On the goal line, which should be the full length of
the room from the starting line, are laid as many oranges
as there are contestants. At the signal, each contestant,
supplied with a common brass pin, runs to the
goal line, spears an orange with her pin and runs back to
the goal line, all of which looks very simple in print!
Try spearing a heavy orange with a pin, without any
help from your free hand!</p>


<h4>Eggshell Race.</h4>

<p>The contents of eggs are blown out, and each contestant
is given an eggshell and a fan. It is his business
to fan the eggshell to the goal and back to the starting
point, and do it in less time than anyone else can do it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>


<h4>Cut It.</h4>

<p>Long lengths of heavy wrapping paper are procured,
and one length is stretched out before each team of cutters,
there being four on a team. The first one of each
team is given a pair of scissors. At the signal all those
holding scissors start to cut down the length of the
paper, being careful not to cut too wide a strip, as each
cutter should have a fourth of the width of the piece of
paper. When they get to the other end and have cut
their strip they run back and give their scissors to No.
2 of their team. No. 2 repeats their performance as do
No. 3 and No. 4. Of course, the object is to see which
No. 4 can first cut his way down the length of the paper.</p>

<p>It makes a very much better game if the lengths of
paper are stretched out for the cutters, for the paper
cuts much faster and wild mistakes are far more
probable.</p>


<h4>The Blindfolded Race.</h4>

<p>There is nothing more exciting in this race than the
mere fact that all runners are blindfolded. They get
set on the starting line, are shown the goal, blindfolded,
turned around three times, and then told to “Go.”
Where they go is another matter!</p>


<h4>The Ball Game.</h4>

<p>Each contestant is given a rubber ball and a common
pin. He is to roll the ball to the goal and return, the
pin and nothing else being the motive power.</p>


<h4>The Rainy Day.</h4>

<p>Two little women and two big men make a team, and
there can be four or five teams. The first lady of each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
team is supplied with an umbrella, and if you have been
careful to get one that sticks a bit in going up—well!</p>

<p>The lady is to carry the umbrella. At a signal she
and her partner start walking to the other end of the
room, where the lady opens the umbrella, takes the
man’s arm, and, keeping the umbrella over his head all
the way, leads him back to the goal line, where she
closes the umbrella and gives it to the lady of the other
couple making up the team. This lady and her partner
go through the same performance, and the couple which
first returns to the goal line and gets its stubborn umbrella
closed, wins the race for its team.</p>


<h4>The Torches.</h4>

<p>Each contestant is given a lighted candle. He is to
put this in his mouth, and when the signal for starting
is given, is to run as fast as he dares to the goal and return.
If his candle goes out, however, he must return
to the starting point to have it relighted. Contestants
in this race do look so queerish!</p>

<p>The relay plan may be used to good effect.</p>


<h4>Beans.</h4>

<p>Beans are worth their weight in gold when one considers
their fun-making capacity. There are several
ways of carrying beans in a race. One of the most
hazardous of these is to have contestants carry them between
a pair of match sticks. Knitting needles are
even more hazardous. Knives, too, are hardly the
easiest thing in the world on which to carry several
beans, especially when one is in a tearing hurry. Still
another way is to carry as many beans as possible on
the back of the left hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>Whatever the means of carrying the beans from one
place to another, in each case there should be three on
a team, each team supplied with a pan of beans, all the
pans containing the same number, this number varying
with the utensil used. When match sticks or knitting
needles are used, there should be no more than five or
six beans to a pan, but there may be thirty or forty
when the hand or knives are used.</p>

<p>Across the room from each team is an empty pan. At
the signal for starting, the first one of each team starts
carrying as many beans as he can manage across the
room to the empty pan. He drops them into the pan
and hurries back for more. When he has carried the
last bean across the room, he runs back to give his
knitting needle or knife or whatever it may be to the
second one of his team, and this contestant is to run over
to the full pan and start bringing the beans back to the
empty pan in the same fashion in which they went across
the room the first time. When he in turn has carried
them all over he gives his implement to the third and
last member of the team who is to finish the race by
carrying all the beans back across the room once more.
The team that first succeeds in getting all its beans
across the room three times wins the race and all the
beans.</p>


<h4>Heavy, Heavy Hangs Over Thy Head.</h4>

<p>Contestants are lined up against the rear wall in
couples with two couples to each team, one couple standing
in front of the other. Both members of the first
couple of each team are given beanbags which they
place on their heads. At a signal from the leader, all
these first couples with beanbags on their heads run to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
the other end of the room and back and give their beanbags
to the second couples of their teams, whereupon
these second couples put the beanbags on their heads
and run the same course. The couple first reaching
home wins the race.</p>

<p>It sounds easy. There is one technicality however
that adds to the troubles of the runners. Partners must
run with arms linked, and if a beanbag falls, they must
stoop for it with arms still linked. That is <i>so</i> easy when
one of the stoopers has a beanbag on his head!</p>

<small>TRICK GAMES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Plato said, “One can discover more about a person in
an hour’s play with him than is possible in a year’s
conversation with him.”</p>

<p>We found out the real truth of that in our war work
with soldiers and sailors, and we are continuing to see
its truth in our recreation work in communities all over
this country. It is a real revelation to a church to see
how splendid an example of good sportsmanship the
minister sets when he is absolutely duped in a trick
game that sent the others into gales of good-natured
laughter, with him, not at him, and yet comes through
it laughing as heartily as anyone, and sincerely glad for
the huge enjoyment the game created!</p>

<p>Trick games are invaluable not only for developing
the finest kind of sportsmanship in victims and onlookers
alike, however, but they are invaluable too as “fillers-in”
for awkward pauses in an evening’s program. That
is their forte, to bridge over awkward pauses, to keep
interest high, to call forth hearty laughter and best of
all, to create the finest kind of spirit in a social gathering.</p>


<h4>Wrong!</h4>

<p>Tell your guests that there are three words in the
English language which are particularly difficult to
spell, and that a person who can spell them correctly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
can spell almost any word. Ask some individual to spell
the word “receive.” He spells it correctly and you
compliment him and then ask him to spell “believe.”
He does spell it right, but you shake your head and
laughingly say, “Wrong”! Say nothing more than that
but repeat it several times at his insisting that he spelled
“believe” correctly. Usually the next step is, “Well
let’s start over again because I know I spelled those
words correctly!” If the request is not forthcoming,
make the suggestion yourself and start all over with
“receive,” and after “believe” again shake your head
and look shocked beyond words at the ignorance evidenced,
and say “Wrong!”</p>

<p>If you are not fatally injured by this time, suggest
again that you start from the beginning, and again after
“believe” say “Wrong,” with a shocked look. Eventually
your victim will arrive and spell “W-r-o-n-g!”</p>


<h4>Palmistry.</h4>

<p>This is always done by some very attractive girl.
She will guarantee to read the palm of any man present,
and leave it to the crowd if all she reads in his palm
is not in accordance with what they know of him. Some
well-known and popular man is chosen as the subject,
and with the rest of the guests silent so that everything
she says may be heard, she begins reading his palm.
Her conversation may run as follows: “Now this is
your head line, and it shows that you have a great many
possibilities which you are not developing. Your heart
line over here is woefully cracked. I’m not going into
detail there! Your life line is firm and unbroken and
it shows almost no ill health, but it does show an early
and painful death because this line right here (pointing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
to any other line) shows that you are an awful flirt and
let young ladies hold your hand right out in public!”</p>


<h4>Of What Are Matches Made?</h4>

<p>This is best for a small group. Arrange four squares
of matches on a table or a book. Ask your guests to
take away four matches, and rearrange three, thus
writing out the name of the thing of which matches are
made. Invariably they will try to spell “Wood” and
they have a real task ahead of them. What matches
are really made of is “love,” which is very easy to
spell in the required way!</p>


<h4>Crystal Gazing.</h4>

<p>Choose a guest who is fairly dignified but ready to
appreciate a joke even though the joke be on him. Tell
him that to read his thoughts is really a simple matter
if he will look into quiet waters and do just what you
tell him to do. Be perfectly serious in all that you say,
for if you act as though it is going to be something
funny, you scare off the bravest guest ever entertained.</p>

<p>Take two glasses of water, full to the brim. You
take a sip out of one and ask him to take one from the
other. Then slowly move the glasses around in a circular
motion two or three times. Ask your victim to
kneel and to place both hands on the floor with fingers
spread out to enable him to hold the glasses securely
without spilling any water. Put a glass on each hand,
very emphatically stating that for either you or him to
spill even one drop of water is against the spirit of the
proceeding. Make a real point of this, for subjects are
always scared to death that you are going to throw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
water on them, and I can’t say that I’d appreciate that
little bit of humor myself.</p>

<p>After the glasses are safely placed on his hands your
conversation should run something like this: “Wait till
that water quiets down and then look very intently into
the glass on your right hand, the one out of which you
drank. Then make a wish, a real one, not about something
silly like the weather, but a wish that could come
true before the end of the year. Don’t tell us what your
wish is but tell us when you have made it, and almost
at once I can tell you what your wish was and whether
it will come true or not.”</p>

<p>That is the correct time for you to go to another and
healthier part of the room. “Well, I’ve made my wish,”
comes almost at once. Your reply is an indifferent, “Oh
that’s all right. That doesn’t make any difference!”
and you pay no more attention to his protests until the
other guests have had their fill of the hilarious laughter
that is inevitable at his ridiculous plight, whereupon
you tell him that he is wishing you would take the water
off his hands, and that his wish will come true!</p>


<h4>Paralysis.</h4>

<p>This can be the funniest thing imaginable. Choose
someone who is not liable to look very deeply into the
hidden meaning of your explanations. Tell him that
if he will do exactly as you ask, you can hypnotize him
so that it will be physically impossible for him to get
up alone. Let me give you a skull and crossbones
warning to put your emphasis on “alone,” and not on
“up.”</p>

<p>You and your victim are seated facing each other,
but make a great point of the fact that you don’t have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
to touch him to hypnotize him. Ask him to look straight
into your eyes and try to get into the spirit of the
thing. He is to do everything you do and in the same
way. That always seems to make victims feel that if
you can do it without bodily injury, they too stand a
good chance of coming out of it alive!</p>

<p>The process of hypnotism is on. Make the most
ridiculous motions you can think of, accompanied by
the most ridiculous noises, all the time looking intently
at your subject. For example, sing up the scale (a
process which many of us would make a ridiculous
noise!) at the same time twiddling your fingers on top
of your head as though the fingers were paper ribbons
fluttering in the breezes. Your subject imitates you.
Rub your hands together as though they were cymbals,
while you buzz like a bee. The victim cymbalizes and
buzzes. Five or six of these hypnotizing motions, conscientiously
imitated, generally have the effect of paralyzing
the audience with no further effort on your part,
while the victim begins to “feel queer already!” Just
about then you give one last intent look, one last hypnotizing
motion, and tell him in a sepulchral tone that
now it will be absolutely impossible for him to get up
alone.</p>

<p>He experiments, putting out first one foot and then
the other, and finally stands up triumphantly and crows,
“Well I guess you didn’t hypnotize me! I stood up
alone!” “Oh no you didn’t,” comes the answer, “I
got up with you. You didn’t get up alone!”</p>


<h4>Owa Tagoo Siam!</h4>

<p>Tell your guests that the Siamese national slogan is
very intricate and that only really intelligent people can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
learn it, but that you have a way of teaching it so that
even the simplest person can grasp it immediately. Ask
them to repeat what you say. “Owa!” with emphasis
on the o; “Tagoo!” with emphasis on the goo; “Siam!”
Then ask them to repeat, running all three words together.
They will have to do it over and over with
much help and encouragement from you before they
appreciate the full meaning of your scornful “Well I
should say you are!”</p>

<p>Finally they arrive. Each one is exclaiming “Oh
what a goose I am!”</p>


<h4>Abbreviations.</h4>

<p>Ask some dignified man to put the tip of his forefinger
under his chin. While he holds it there ask him
to tell the assembled multitude the abbreviation for
quart. He will look the part when he says “Q-t,”
which you’ll all agree sounds like “Cutie.”</p>

<p>Later on get some other guest to point his forefinger
at his head and show how well educated he is by
immediately giving the abbreviation for mountain
“M-t.” certainly sounds like “empty” though it would
hardly be right for any of the other guests to thus
describe the victim’s head!</p>


<h4>Under the Table.</h4>

<p>Let the host make a wager with one of his men guests
that he cannot get under the dining table or some small
sidetable and stay there while his host knocks three
times on the table. “Why that would take just a
second! Surely I can!” He gets under the table and
his host knocks once and twice and then knocks no more
but proceeds to lead his guests out of the room, leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
his betting friend either to pay up, or wait indefinitely
under the table for the third knock!</p>


<h4>Impossible!</h4>

<p>“Would you like to see something that has never been
seen before and that will never be seen again?”</p>

<p>“Impossible!”</p>

<p>Whereupon you pick up an English walnut or any
kind of nut, crack it, take out the kernel and ask if it
has ever been seen before; then eat it and ask if it will
ever be seen again!</p>


<h4>The Lost Sheep.</h4>

<p>This is to follow some vocal selection that gained
enough applause to justify an encore. Immediately
following the announcement that the next number is
to be a little ballad entitled “The Lost Sheep,” the
accompanist begins an elaborate accompaniment with
an introduction that is unusually long. At the correct
moment she crashes out a loud chord and signals to
the singer to begin. The singer takes a deep breath,
holds it as long as she can, and then gives forth one
heart-rending “Baa!”, the song of the lost sheep.</p>


<h4>The Gathering of the Nuts.</h4>

<p>It is announced that an impromptu farce will be
staged, with guests taking the various parts. As the
different guests are assigned parts they are in turn
called to the stage and told where and how to stand.
If a large group is present, from fifteen to twenty actors
are used; if a small group, all of them may take part.
A list of the various rôles has been made out, and the
announcer begins calling out characters with the name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
of the guest who is to take each part. The following
cast is used to good advantage:</p>

<p>1. Two footlights, who sit at the front of the stage,
upright when the footlights are on, but with faces to
floor when off.</p>

<p>2. Curtain. A large man who stands at the middle
back. When curtain goes up, arms are outstretched.</p>

<p>3. Scenery. Two girls who stand in right and left
corners at the back of the stage with fingertips on top
of their heads.</p>

<p>4. The Table. Two short men who, facing each other,
bend over till the tops of their heads come together
forming an ideal tabletop.</p>

<p>5. The Davenport. Two men who kneel facing each
other with hands joined as near the floor as possible.</p>

<p>6. The Lamp. A tall girl with a very fixed radiant
smile.</p>

<p>7. The Clock. A girl who moves her head from side
to side, saying automatically, “Tick, tock, tick, tock!”</p>

<p>8. Exits. Two people standing at each door with
joined hands held high to form a passageway.</p>

<p>9. The Heroine. A tall stout girl who stares dreamily
at one of the light fixtures.</p>

<p>10. Her Mother, who stares adoringly at her.</p>

<p>11. Her Father. A picture of righteous wrath.</p>

<p>12. The Hero. A small meek man on his knees at the
feet of the heroine.</p>

<p>13. The Villain. Arms crossed, sneer, air of defiance.
Much showing teeth and twirling of mustache.</p>

<p>After they are all in their right places with instructions
as to how to look and act, footlights go on, curtain
goes up, and the announcer breaks in hurriedly, “Oh!
I forgot to tell you the name of this play! It is ‘The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
Gathering of the Nuts!’”, whereupon she makes a hasty
exit!</p>


<h4>The Band.</h4>

<p>Guests are told that the object of the game is for each
one to pantomime the action of the instrument assigned
him, in such a realistic way that the others cannot help
but guess what it is. Each performer is to continue his
pantomiming until the audience makes the correct guess.
The hostess then asks the first performer to step into
another room with her so that she can tell him what
his instrument is, and help him with the action of it.
She assigns him something easy like a cornet, telling
him at the same time however that his part is really a
blind to keep the group from getting suspicious about
any hoax. He goes back into the room, pantomimes the
action of a cornet, and immediately the audience guesses
“Cornet,” and probably thinks “Oh what a stupid
game!”</p>

<p>The hostess carefully picks her next performer, takes
him into the next room, and tells him his part. He is
to play the accordion, and, according to rule, is to keep
it up until the audience makes a correct guess as to his
instrument. In the meantime, the man who played the
cornet is carrying out the instructions given him by
his hostess, and is telling the group that the next man
will play an accordion, but that they are all to profess
great ignorance and to guess everything under the sun
but an accordion—a piano, a piccolo, drum, flute, violin,
trombone, anything but an accordion. Inevitably the
impatient question will come from the performer,
“Well! What is it that I’m playing?” and the group
will sweetly answer, “The part of the goat!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span></p>


<h4>Whistle!</h4>

<p>The group is told that a whistle will be blown behind
the back of whoever is chosen to go into the center,
and that he, because of a magic coat he has put on, has
clairvoyant power and can immediately turn around
and tell who did it. If he should by some mishap make
an error, he may try again and he can without question
guess who did it the second time.</p>

<p>Mr. Victim goes into the center and the magic coat
is put across his shoulders. Great care must be used
however so that he cannot possibly see that the whistle,
which is a very light one, is hanging on a short cord
pinned securely on the back of the coat just between
the shoulders. The sleeves are tied in front and the
coat is bunched across his back so that plenty of thickness
is arranged for in order that he may not feel the
whistle as he turns around rapidly. Other guests crowd
in on him very closely so that the whistle can be reached
easily and can be blown by any one of the onlookers
without the victim’s feeling the tug.</p>

<p>When the leader says that all is ready, someone back
of him blows an earsplitting blast on the whistle. Immediately
everyone puts his hands behind him. Mr.
Victim turns around at once and accuses the guiltiest
looking one of holding the whistle. The guilty looking
party holds up his hands and shows that he has no
whistle and vows that he did not pass it to anyone else.
Only one guess as to who did it is allowed in each case
and the one accused is to hold up his hands at once,
to prove his innocence or guilt.</p>

<p>Sooner or later the unfortunate in the center discovers
who has been holding the whistle all the time, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
is the strategic time for everyone to go into the other
room!</p>


<h4>The Prison Guard.</h4>

<p>For a small group only. Make a square representing
a prison on a piece of paper, not joining the lines at the
corners however. Let “P” represent a prisoner in the
center of the square. At three of the corners let “G”
represent guards. The story is that the prisoner
escaped in spite of the guards, that there was a guard
at this, and this, and this gate, pointing with your pencil
to the three gates at which are stationed guards. Ask
how in the world he could have escaped.</p>

<p>Invariably someone answers, “Why he could have
gone through this gate,” and puts the tip of his finger
on the unguarded gate. Your pencil is resting carelessly
on the paper. At the crucial moment you hold
it poised and when the answer comes and the finger
points to the unguarded gate, your pencil comes into
action with a swift rap across the knuckles as you
exclaim in surprise, “Oh no! <i>I</i> am guarding that gate!”</p>


<h4>Magic Writing.</h4>

<p>The magic writer sends his confederate out of the room
while the group decides on some short active verb. On
his return the magician will write out this word in magic
writing, whereupon the confederate will immediately
go through the action of the verb decided upon.</p>

<p>That verb may be “dance.” When the confederate
comes into the room the magician must be careful to say
nothing that is not connected with his magic writing,
or he will confuse his confederate. The first thing he
says is, “Don’t get excited.” He then makes a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
many fantastic motions on the floor with an umbrella,
suddenly tapping hard, just once. Then he remarks,
“Now be careful,” and after a very short pause, “Come
on and try it,” and finishes with more flourishes of
the umbrella and two distinct taps. Immediately the
confederate, without saying a word, starts to dance.</p>

<p>It is a simple matter—when one knows how. The
flourishes and the fantastic motions mean nothing, but
all conversation and the taps mean a great deal. The
first letter of each sentence gives the necessary consonant,
and the taps give the vowels. For example, the first
letter of the first sentence was “d.” Next came one
tap, the first vowel “a,” then, “n,” then “c,” and then
two taps for “e” the second vowel, and there you have
“d-a-n-c-e.” The vowels come in their usual order of
course, a, e, i, o, u, with one tap for a, two taps for e,
three taps for i, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Discourage any other than short verbs. Imagine
living through “palpitate!”</p>


<h4>Hee Haw!</h4>

<p>The group is told that at a signal, each one is to
imitate the call of the animal assigned him, to see which
one can do it the most realistically and still be heard
above the others. Assistants go about, supposedly assigning
the names of animals, but in reality whispering
to everyone to make no sound at all. Only one person
is told to really imitate the call of an animal. That is
a victim who is to represent a donkey. When the signal
comes, he “Hee Haw’s!” at the top of his lungs, blithely
unconscious of the fact that he is alone in his efforts.
That state of bliss does not last long!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span></p>


<h4>Willie.</h4>

<p>The leader holds her left hand in front of her, fingers
spread out. With her right forefinger she traces her
way along the inside of the fingers of her left hand.
To illustrate, she starts at the tip of the thumb, comes
down, and up to the tip of the forefinger, down it and
up the second finger, and so on through all the fingers.
She then starts at the thumb and does the same thing
again. From the very first she has been saying, “Willie,
Willie, Willie, Willie, <i>little</i> Willie, Willie, Willie!” in
the most pitiful tone she can muster up, and in rhythm
with her finger movements. She then quietly folds her
hands and says “Now you do it.”</p>

<p>It looks so simple that it isn’t even funny until two
or three people try it and make utter failures of it.
Because she scowled when she did it, they scowl, thinking
that that is the trick; because she used a pitiful tone,
they use one; and they imitate her finger movements
exactly, while she criticizes them for not getting the little
finger just right. Finally someone arrives. It is the
quiet folding of the hands at the end that is all-important.</p>


<h4>Wonderful Vision.</h4>

<p>The leader may claim that it is a perfectly simple
matter for him to see through any amount of covering
over his eyes. To test his vision, he chooses five or six
testers if the group is large, but if there are not more
than ten present they may all be included. They form
a circle around his chair, first covering up his eyes so
that he cannot possibly see. He then asks them to start
moving slowly around him, each one doing something
that no one else is doing. One may hop on one foot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
another clap his hands, another do facial gymnastics,
fly, walk backwards, anything that no one else is doing,
but each one must go through some action or the thought
wave is broken and the wonderful vision impaired. One
person is designated to suddenly stop all action after a
minute or two of moving around, by clapping his hands
and calling out, “Now! Exactly what is each one of us
doing?” and the leader promises on his word of honor
that in spite of the heavy covering over his eyes he can
without a moment’s hesitation tell what every last person
in the moving circle was doing at that identical
moment.</p>

<p>The circle begins moving slowly around, each one in
it going through some definite movement, and each one
wondering, probably, how in the world the blindfolded
leader will be able to tell that the Methodist minister
is wiggling his ears, and that Mrs. Newly Rich is doing
an esthetic dance. Suddenly a halt is called by the one
chosen to do it. He claps his hands briskly and says,
“Now tell us what we were doing at the moment I
clapped my hands.”</p>

<p>The leader throws off the covering, looks intently at
the group and then says with great satisfaction, “Each
one of you was making a goose of himself!”</p>


<h4>The Elastic Ring.</h4>

<p>A guest with a large head is chosen as the one on
whom to experiment. The hostess holds up a lady’s ring
and assures her guests that if she, while facing this guest,
holds the ring in just the right position she can easily
poke her guest’s head right through it without hurting
him in the least. It sounds incredible but her friend of
the large head stands obediently before her, she twists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
and turns the ring to get just the right position, finally
succeeds, and giving a sigh of satisfaction, proceeds to
poke his head through the ring by putting her finger
through the ring and poking his head!</p>


<h4>Rabbit.</h4>

<p>The leader shows great enthusiasm in asking her guests
if they know that “awfully funny new game ‘Rabbit.’”
If a small group, all may join in; if a large one, only a
select few have the privilege. They form a circle, kneel
on the right knee, each one putting the first finger of
the right hand on the floor. When they are all set the
leader asks again as if to make sure, “Really don’t you
know how to play ‘Rabbit’?” and again they assure her
that they do not.</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” she remarks regretfully.</p>


<h4>Rubber!</h4>

<p>The leader has a rubber band at the base of the first
two fingers of her left hand which is closed. She opens
the hand suddenly and throws the rubber in such a way
that it jumps clear across to the base of the third and
fourth fingers of the same hand. Impossible? Not a
bit, but only clever people can do it, or at least so the
guests are told.</p>

<p>The rubber band is put at the base of the first two
fingers. All four fingers are then folded over and the
rubber is stretched a bit so that it may cover all four
tips. When the fingers are stretched out straight it is
inevitable that the rubber band jump to the base of
the third and fourth fingers.</p>


<h4>The Unbreakable Match.</h4>

<p>A man’s handkerchief is opened up and waved about
to show how free it is from any trickery. A match is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
put in the exact center of the handkerchief which is then
carefully folded up. Complete silence is asked for in
order that all may hear the leader break the match.
They listen carefully and admit that they hear the
distinct crack of the match as it is broken. The leader
shakes out the handkerchief and the match is shown,
unbroken.</p>

<p>She repeats the performance, and each time all will
admit that they heard her break the match. There are
always many theories advanced as to how she does it—by
cracking her finger-nails together, etc., etc., and there
is always somebody who wants to see the handkerchief.
Instead of showing it, however, she shakes it freely and
tells them that that ought to satisfy anybody.</p>

<p>Just between us, there is a match pushed far into
the hem at all four corners. Each time she is supposed
to be cracking the match in the center of the handkerchief,
she is very careful to crack one of the corner
matches instead!</p>


<h4>Leterfly.</h4>

<p>Leterfly and Salaam are quite evidently not for exactly
formal dress affairs! Leterfly is especially good
for Poverty Parties and the like, and is best adapted to
a small group. Guests are told that one by one they
will be introduced to the Fly Family. The leader
chooses four assistants, and the rest of the guests are
taken aside some place where they cannot see the presentations.
The assistants are lined up like a receiving
line as the Fly Family, and as the guests come in, one
at a time, they are presented to each member of the
family. The first one is the butterfly, next the firefly,
then the dragonfly, and lastly leterfly, who does what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
her name implies and lets fly about ten drops of cold
water from a thimble which she has held concealed at
her side.</p>


<h4>Salaam.</h4>

<p>His Majesty, the King of Timbuktu, is seated on his
throne at one end of the room with a page close at hand.
Four or five people have been asked to leave the room
and to come in one at a time as called, in order to be
presented to His Majesty. The first one is called in,
brought before the king, told to bow deeply before him
three times, each time saying, “I pledge allegiance to
my king.” He is told too, that the deeper his bow, the
greater his favor with the king. He bows once, then
again, and then a third time. His allegiance gets a bit
chilled however during the third bow, for the page has
provided the king with a small piece of ice, which is
gently but firmly applied to the back of the neck during
the third bow.</p>


<h4>Hypnotism.</h4>

<p>Much care is evidenced in the selecting of a subject
for hypnotism. It is hardly necessary to say that a
confederate is in the group. The hypnotist goes about
touching different people’s temples to see whether they
are the right kind for hypnotism. He finally discovers
a good subject, his confederate of course. The subject
is sent out of the room while the group decides on something
they want him to do when hypnotized. Perhaps
they want him to sing. He is seated on a chair facing
the audience and the hypnotist begins to rub his forehead
slowly. The movements are slow and well defined,
that is, the fingers are lifted after each move across the
forehead. The subject soon loses consciousness and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
the movements continue, seems to get more and more
under the spell of the hypnotist. Finally with a shaking
of his fingers the hypnotist stops and there is absolute
silence for just a moment, in order to keep the subject
under the spell. Suddenly he begins singing in a high
squeaky voice, “Wait till the Sun Shines Nellie!”</p>

<p>If the subject has any relatives present they will
almost surely beg that he be taken out of his trance.
The obliging hypnotist presses his fingers twice into
the temples of the subject who shudders, sighs, and
wakes up wondering what it is all about!</p>

<p>Frankly, it is not easy to do unless both subject and
hypnotist are very alert and wideawake. If they are,
however, it is a comparatively simple process to hypnotize
a confederate into doing anything the audience
wants him to do. We assume that they want him to sing.
The hypnotist begins rubbing his forehead and carefully
rubs nineteen times, for “s,” the first letter in sing,
is the nineteenth letter of the alphabet. He carefully
lifts his fingers at the end of each movement. After
the nineteenth rub he presses hard into both temples
to show that the letter is completed. Waiting just a
second, he begins again and rubs nine times for “i,”
the ninth letter of the alphabet, pressing the temples at
the end. The next time he rubs fourteen times for
“n,” and the last time only seven times for “g,” at
the end of which he shakes his fingers vigorously as a
signal that the word is completed.</p>

<p>It will make it more interesting for all concerned if
the hypnotist asks the audience to choose verbs of three
or four letters. His explanation is that simple action
is very easy to get over even to a new subject, while
long and complicated action takes practice. The real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
reason is that it is fairly easy for a subject to get the
words “cry,” or “dance” or “sleep” or “jump,” while
“hippity-hop” would be almost impossible and too long
drawn out to be interesting.</p>

<p>If a hypnotist can get a confederate who will get
thoroughly into the spirit of the thing and sigh, shudder,
go into a trance, or act completely exhausted, while the
hypnotist himself makes a serious thing out of it, a
group can be completely deceived as to the genuineness
of the performance.</p>


<h4>Eny.</h4>

<p>This is particularly good for a table game or in any
situation where there is no room for moving around.
Announce that there is a word in the English language
that ends in “eny,” pronounced like “any.” It is
necessary to put just one letter at the beginning to
make it a very common and much used word. Suggest
that they begin with “a” putting every letter of the
alphabet in turn before “eny” till the proper letter is
found. The usual process is this: “A-eny, b-eny, c-eny,
d-eny, f-eny, g-eny, h-eny,” and so on through the entire
alphabet until an impatient “Why there isn’t a single
letter that will do it,” calls forth your positive assurance
that there is a letter that will do it.</p>

<p>If they simply cannot get it, ask them to change the
accent. Finally they will arrive. “D-eny” is a perfectly
good word.</p>


<h4>“T.”</h4>

<p>Guests are sitting about informally when the hostess
turns to her right-hand neighbor, Mrs. Brown, and says,
“I simply can’t abide ‘t’ but I like onions. What do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
you like, Mrs. Brown?” and Mrs. Brown, who knows
the game, answers, “I don’t like ‘t’ but I like cabbage,”
and turns to the next one who is in the dark as to what
they are talking about, and asks her what she likes.
She replies, “Well, I don’t like tea but I love soda
water,” but laughter greets her and she is told that she
certainly cannot join their secret organization. Her
right-hand neighbor then tells what she likes, and so it
goes around the circle, all the uninitiated trying valiantly
to get in on this secret understanding that seems
to be so funny. Before it has gone around the circle
once, however, someone gets it. She is not allowed to
tell, but when her turn comes in the second round she
gives evidence as to whether she is right or not. She
might say perhaps, “I don’t like ‘t’ but I do like
pickles!” and she is declared an initiated member.</p>

<p>It is very simple. If you wish to belong to the “Anti-T”
band your taste must run to food that has no “t”
in it, like pickles, soup, etc., etc. but not like potatoes,
turnips or ketchup!</p>


<h4>Self Praise.</h4>

<p>The hostess makes a remark to the effect that “This
group is mighty good-looking,” accompanying the remark
with a very prim, set smile, and then asks the
one at her right to repeat it exactly as she gave it.
The neighbor gives what she considers an exact duplication
of the remark and the smile, but she is told that
she isn’t even warm, so the next one tries it and so it
goes around the circle, with some of them utter failures
and others very successful. This continues until most
of them have arrived.</p>

<p>Many of them put the greatest emphasis on the smile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
thinking that that is the important factor, which of
course is just exactly what you wanted them to think,
for half the fun of the game is caused by the utterly
hopeless smiles that are forthcoming. The successful
ones however have noticed that each time before you
made a remark you cleared your throat. Easy, isn’t it,
when you know how?</p>


<h4>No Fair!</h4>

<p>Two of the men are blindfolded and are asked to sit
in the middle of the circle on the floor, facing each other
with knees touching. Each one is given a swatter, made
of newspapers folded together. At a signal, the smaller
one of the two is told to call out to the other “Where
are you?” and the big one is to answer “Right here,”
and then without moving his knees he may dodge in
any way he can to avoid the sweep of the swatter that
his opponent aims in the direction of the “Right here.”
He may be successful in his dodging, but then again,
he may not, and he gets a “swat” that calls for revenge,
so he takes his turn, and calls out, “Where are you?”,
and the small one answers, “Right here” and immediately
dodges as best he can the avenging swatter that
is swatting in his direction. They take turns at this
for a few moments and then the small one, to whom
the leader has whispered a few words when he was blindfolding
him, slips down the blindfolder and gets in
several good dodges and several good swats before his
opponent gets suspicious that all is not well!</p>


<h4>Mr. Bumps.</h4>

<p>The leader invites her guests to watch very closely the
ceremony she will go through in honor of her friend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Mr. Bumps, and tells them that an opportunity will be
given to imitate the ceremony.</p>

<p>She sits at a table with a glass of water before her
and with all simplicity begins her ceremony. Holding
the glass between the thumb and forefinger of her right
hand she takes a sip of water and says, “I drink to
Mr. Bumps,” puts the glass down, taps on top of the
table with her right forefinger, does the same with her
left forefinger, repeats the finger tapping performance
under the edge of the table, taps the floor with her right
foot, then her left foot, and finally, bows her head once.</p>

<p>The second part of the ceremony is exactly like the
first except that everything is done twice and the glass
is held between the thumb and two fingers instead of
just one finger. Two drinks are taken; the toast, “I
drink to Mr. Bumps twice,” is given; the right forefinger
and the left forefinger tap twice on top of the
table and twice under the edge of the table; the right
foot and then the left foot tap on the floor; and the
head is bowed twice.</p>

<p>The third and last part of the ceremony too is just
like the first, except that everything is done three times,
and the glass is held between the thumb and three
fingers, and the toast is, “I drink to Mr. Bumps for
the third and last time.”</p>

<p>A cordial invitation to do likewise is then issued.
While the explanation as given here may sound rather
complicated, the performance really looks extremely
simple, and in the average group there will be several
who are sure they can do it. I have never yet seen a person
do it absolutely correctly with the first effort, and
it usually takes several efforts to master this apparently
very simple procedure. Every applicant is given just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
one chance in the first round and at his first mistake
he is supplanted by a new applicant. When they have
all been given a chance (and incidentally all have failed)
they are all urged to try again and each successive time
it becomes easier but only one mistake is allowed in each
trial.</p>

<p>You may look skeptical at the statement that real
head-work is essential. My only answer is, “Try it!”</p>


<h4>I Hypnotize You!</h4>

<p>If the group is large, some five or six guests are asked
to sit in a circle in front of the audience. If there are
not more than ten guests present, let them all form a
circle, seated, with a person who will make a good victim
next to the leader. A good victim is not always only
a good sport. He is inevitably that, but in addition, a
leader who chooses her subjects wisely will choose one
who will not readily see the hoax. In this case the
victim is entirely unconscious of the important part he
is to play.</p>

<p>The leader tells the group that certain very simple
movements of the hands across the forehead of a subject
can hypnotize that subject in almost no time, and without
actually hypnotizing her subject she will demonstrate
on her neighbor, so that they may all see the
principle of the thing and practice on their neighbors
before the real hypnotizing begins. Subjects in each
case should be right-hand neighbors. Assuring her right-hand
neighbor in all seriousness that she is only going
through the motions of hypnotizing, without really accomplishing
anything, she begins demonstrating on him.
Her hands are lying folded in her lap. Her first request
is very important, but she is very casual as she asks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
her victim to close his eyes, as she wishes to make certain
movements over the closed eyes. As soon as his eyes
are closed she makes several soft, gentle movements
directly around and over his eyes, making much of the
point that she is only demonstrating and not actually
hypnotizing. When she has done the thing to her own
satisfaction, she folds her hands again and tells him to
open his eyes, while he, together with the rest of the
group, is to practice these movements preparatory to
some actual hypnotizing.</p>

<p>Mr. Victim cannot understand the very unreasonable
mirth of the other members of the circle, who have all
they can do to keep upright as they make a pretense
of practicing on each other. He finally gets suspicious
however, and goes to a mirror. What he sees there
leaves no doubt in his mind as to what they were finding
so extremely funny!</p>

<p>The leader’s hands, which were folded so innocently
in her lap, had previously been generously coated with
lampblack, all of which had transferred itself to his
face!</p>


<h4>Magic Photography.</h4>

<p>This is for a small group of guests who know each
other fairly well. The photographer boasts that he can
take an impression of a person’s face on the back of a
spoon, and make it so real that another person who has
been out of the room can almost immediately tell whose
picture was taken.</p>

<p>In the face of the scoffing, he sends someone (of course
his confederate) out of the room, and sets about taking
the picture of one of the guests on the back of a spoon.
He rubs the spoon over the entire face, pressing into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
depressions at either side of the nose and being sure to
get the mold of the chin. He then calls in the one who
was out of the room, shows him the spoon and asks,
“What beauty is it?” At once comes the answer,
“Winona Beal,” and he is right. He goes out again
and when he has been called in the second time, the
photographer says, showing him the spoon, “Go ahead!”
and the answer is, “It is Gertrude Addams,” and again
he is right.</p>

<p>The solution is this: The first two words of the photographer’s
statement have as their first letters the
initials of the one photographed. “What beauty is it?”
gave the initials “W” and “B” and “Go ahead” gave
“G” and “A.”</p>

<p>In games of this kind, instead of endeavoring to find
out the trick used, there is the inevitable someone who
says, “Let me go out.” It has proved wise to let one
of these inevitables go out of the room, telling him when
he comes back that you are not sure that he will be
quick enough to get the resemblance on the spoon,
thereby putting the burden of proof on him. Sure
enough, he fails, and almost always your group will ask
that the one who was first sent out of the room be sent
again, for no trick that does not work is interesting.</p>

<p>It is another matter when someone thinks he has discovered
your trick. Instead of telling the group what
he thinks it is, you ask him to leave the room in place
of your confederate and when he gets back and tells
correctly whose picture is on the spoon, it is much to
the delight of the crowd. As each one of them discovers
the trick and is allowed to try out his discovery, one
by one they guess it, and nothing puts a crowd into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
better humor than to have guessed a trick which looked
hard!</p>


<h4>The Pain.</h4>

<p>There may in this very large world still be one or even
two people who have not heard of the way to hypnotize
a person so that he will inevitably feel a pain (pane).
The hypnotist makes several passes before the eyes of
the subject, stares at him fixedly, presses his hands on
the temple of the subject, leads him to a window, raps
his hand very lightly on the glass, holds his fingers
there, and then inquires solicitously, and yet triumphantly,
“You feel a pane now, don’t you?”</p>

<p>The subject, who feels absolutely no discomfort or
pain, says so freely, but he is corrected by the hypnotist
who assures him that he certainly is feeling pane!</p>


<h4>Teapot.</h4>

<p>This game centers about words that have two meanings
like “can.” It is used to best advantage with a small
informal group. The leader starts it by saying “I teapot
teapot peaches when I teapot get them,” and the
neighbor to her right is to take up the conversation
if she can think of the word in the place of which teapot
was used. She guesses correctly so she says, “Most
teapots are made of tin, but I teapot show you a teapot
made of glass.” Her right-hand neighbor has not the
slightest inkling of what word they are thinking about,
so she is obliged to pass, and so it goes around the circle,
anyone who passes being obliged to pay a forfeit. When
each one has had a turn and it comes back to the leader
she tells what word she had in mind, “can.”</p>

<p>Then she starts another one, this one perhaps, “see,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
and as before, she omits the word “see” and uses “teapot”
instead. For example, “I did teapot the teapot
when a fearful storm was up, and I am sure that I shall
never again teapot such a raging teapot.”</p>

<p>Sometimes the leader will call upon someone else to
start a new word, and in each case, anyone who is unable
to “catch on” pays a forfeit.</p>


<h4>Magic Numbers.</h4>

<p>Children love easy trick games which they may try
out on each other. One of the easiest and simplest of
these is one in which someone, a confederate of course,
is sent out of the room while the others decide on some
number under ten. Perhaps they decide on six. The
outsider is called in and the leader remarks to him,
“Fire Away,” and immediately he says, “You decided
on six.”</p>

<p>The next time when they chose four for their number,
the leader said to his confederate, “Do you think you
can get it from looking at me?” and of course the confederate
said, “Easily. It is four.”</p>

<p>The first letter of any remark the leader makes tells
the confederate what number has been decided upon.
In “Fire away,” the first letter was “f,” which is the
sixth letter of the alphabet. Therefore, six was the
number chosen. In “Do you think” etc., etc., “d,” the
fourth letter of the alphabet, gives the number four.</p>


<h4>Red, White and Blue.</h4>

<p>This is one of the most irritating and fascinating
puzzles ever put to an informal group. While the confederate
is out of the room the leader asks the guests
to decide on any object in the room. The confederate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
is called in and after naming several wrong articles in
the room, asking each time if that is the one chosen, the
leader names the right one and instantly the answer is
made, “That is the thing you chose.” Immediately
someone says, “Oh, it is just like ‘Black Magic’ except
that you name a red object just before the right one.”</p>

<p>The leader smiles and answers, “All right. Just
watch this next time,” and next time the right object
certainly was not preceded by an object that was red,
nor was it the next time. As it happened, however,
when the leader pointed out wrong objects and finally
the right one the <i>next</i> time, the right one was preceded
by something red and every last guest noticed it and
spoke of it, but they could not say that the trick was
that the right object was always preceded by something
red, for that was not true.</p>

<p>The system used is indeed very much like “Black
Magic” in which the object decided upon is always
preceded by an object that is black, but in this case
the right object is preceded by objects that are red,
white and blue, in turn. The first time it follows a red
object, next a white one, and then a blue one. Then
the series begins all over again, first a red object to
precede it, then a white one, and then a blue one and
so on till finally some bright mind recognizes the familiar
combination!</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br>

<small>PICNICS!</small></h2>
</div>

<p>This chapter is headed “Picnics” but a great many
of the events included may be used to good advantage
in the gymnasium, as well as out-of-doors.</p>


<h3><i>Races.</i></h3>


<h4>The Horse Races.</h4>

<p>It certainly is fun to play baseball on horseback, but
it is a great deal funnier to race on horseback, unless—your
horse falls down!</p>

<p>Each runner sits on a horse, and at a signal from the
starter the horses start running for the goal, some fifty
feet away. All the runner has to do is to “sit tight”
and, if possible, keep his horse from going down flat,
for it surely is not the horse who gets the worst of that
possible episode! They must return to the starting
point, and if the relay plan is used, touch off the next
horse and his rider, who must run the same course.</p>


<h4>The Baby Carriage Contest.</h4>

<p>If possible get two or three obsolete baby carriages,
each carriage to be manned by a boy and a man. The
boy is the rider of course, but if it is possible to find
a man small enough to ride in the carriage without
totally demolishing it, substitute this small man for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
boy, for nothing looks funnier than a grown up man
scrunched down into a baby carriage, with his feet
dangling overboard!</p>

<p>The race is just like any other race, to a goal and
return, except that it is harder to look at without hurting
one’s self!</p>


<h4>The Rollers.</h4>

<p>“Whoops” under “Races” may be used at a picnic
for a woman’s race. Another race, run on the same
principle, uses automobile tires as the thing to be rolled
by hand, men, of course, being contestants.</p>

<p>Hardboiled eggs too, make wonderful “rollers,” and
should be rolled to the goal and return by means of
lead pencils or hairpins.</p>


<h4>The Sack Race.</h4>

<p>Just the plain old-fashioned sack race, in which contestants
have both legs in a sack and must run to the
goal and return, thus impeded. Excitement is added if
the relay plan is used, whereby each runner must, on
returning to the starting point, take off his sack and
give it to the other runner of his team! When one is
in a hurry that is a very easy thing to do!</p>


<h4>The New Era.</h4>

<p>Men only are allowed to enter as contestants, and each
is given a lady’s skirt which he must put on and wear
throughout the race. Men are so graceful anyhow!</p>


<h4>The Sticks.</h4>

<p>Runners are given sawed-off broomsticks which they
are to put under their bent knees. They are to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
them there while they race, inch by inch, to the goal
and back. The course should be a short one.</p>


<h4>The Squatters Race.</h4>

<p>Runners bend knees, squat on heels, and with hands
on hips, go to the goal and return at a whirlwind pace—maybe!
What is more, nothing is said to them about
the way they will undoubtedly feel the next morning!
One should be merciful and make this course, too, a
short one.</p>


<h4>Bang!</h4>

<p>Each contestant is given five common paper bags. At
the signal for starting they are to blow up these bags
one by one, exploding each one as it is filled with air.
The one who first blows up and explodes all his bags
gets a toy balloon.</p>


<h4>The Water Bearers.</h4>

<p>Each runner is given a glass which is full to the brim
of water. All he has to do is to hop on one foot to
the goal and return, carrying the water all the way!
The prize offered for this race should be a generous one!</p>


<h4>The Greased Pole and Pig.</h4>

<p>A picnic would hardly be a picnic unless a greased
pole is counted “among those present.” The pole is
just exactly what it sounds like, a greased pole, and
at the top of it is a tiny flag which must be captured
and brought down by the victorious climber who gets
a very real prize. He deserves it!</p>

<p>A cousin game to that which entails climbing a greased
pole, is one which offers any and everyone the privilege<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
of catching a greased pig. If no fence is available a
barrier is made with strips of canvas, strong strips and
high strips! The pig, which has been made as slippery
as any pig can be made, is turned loose in this inclosure
and the chase is on. The one who catches the pig keeps
him—and welcome!</p>

<p>It might be fitting to suggest that contestants in
either event be offered the temporary use of overalls!</p>


<h4>The Picnic Blues.</h4>

<p>Anxious mothers have been justified in worrying when
they saw Johnny and Henry gobbling down pie in wholesale
and extremely hurried fashion, in a blueberry pie-eating
contest. They know what will happen that night
at 3 a.m.! It is not the blueberries that give her
anxious moments either! Neither is it the contest. It
is the heavenly blue smeared all over the countenance
of Johnny and Henry, in every place a blueberry can
find a foothold! That blue will be just as heavenly and
smear just as well when its source is a thick blue sauce
made of blueberries, and it is put into pie tins for the
same contest.</p>


<h4>The Subway.</h4>

<p>Boys are lined up in columns, six or seven in each
column, with feet spread apart. At a signal from the
leader, the last one of each column gets down on his
hands and knees and crawls through the natural “subway”
to the front. As soon as he gets there he stands
up in front of the column and calls “All set!” whereupon
the last one of the column hurries through the
subway, doing the same thing when he reaches the front.
When the one who was originally the first of the column<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
finally gets his turn and crawls through to his original
place the race is over, and of course, all honor and glory
and a prize to the team that can first get its original
leader back to his place!</p>


<h4>Two in One Race.</h4>

<p>Boys are arranged in couples. The two forming each
couple stand back to back with arms interlocked. One
of them stands facing the goal. When all of the couples
are so arranged, a signal is given and they start running
to the goal, about twenty-five feet away, and return.</p>

<p>Two fat boys linked together and racing in this way
make a sight worth going miles to see!</p>


<h4>Leap Frog.</h4>

<p>The boys are divided into two teams, each team forming
a circle, everyone down on all fours. At a signal,
a designated leader in each circle starts leapfrogging
his way around the circle. When he has leaped ever
the last one he gets down again on all fours and slaps
the one in front of him who starts to leapfrog around
the circle. When he has gone all the way around, he
too squats down, slaps the one in front of him and he
starts his little journey. The circle whose last leapfrogger
first reaches his former place gets the prize.</p>


<h4>The Human Wheelbarrow.</h4>

<p>There are two on a team in this Wheelbarrow Race
but there is no wheelbarrow. One member of the team
is a boy and the other a man. The boy is the wheelbarrow,
and the man the driver. The boy gets down
on his hands and knees, the driver takes hold of his
feet, and when the signal to start comes, lifts the feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
off the ground so that the boy is walking on his hands
alone.</p>

<p>The course, about twenty-five feet in length, should
be on a grassy plot. Let a driver’s sense of humor get
the best of him, as it usually does, and the wheelbarrow
goes flat on his face!</p>


<h4>The Penalty.</h4>

<p>The usual three-legged race is put on with only two
teams competing. Just before they start to run, tell
them that the losers will be made to get down on all
fours, the winners placed on their backs and that they
will be forced to carry the victors the full length of the
course, with all “accidental” tipping positively forbidden!</p>


<h4>Housewives’ Race.</h4>

<p>A large space is cleared with the onlookers forming
a very close circle around it. Contestants are all women
of not less than twenty-five years of age. A chicken is
turned loose in this open space and the woman who
catches it may have it. None of the onlookers may help
her beyond seeing to it that the chicken does not get
outside the circle.</p>

<p>You and I know that the chicken’s freedom is not in
such very grave danger!</p>


<h4>Obstacle Race.</h4>

<p>The course is not longer than fifty yards, and a line
of obstacles is set out for each one of the three teams,
two men or boys in each team.</p>

<p>Runners No. 1 start the race. They are to:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Go through a barrel.<br>
2. Sing up the scale.<br>
3. Turn two somersaults.<br>
4. Take off their shoes and put them on again.<br>
5. Climb a designated tree.</p>
</div>

<p>They then hurry back to touch off No. 2 of their team,
who must go through the same performance. There is
one rule that is strictly enforced. That is that the singing
must be done clearly and distinctly and as musically
as possible!</p>


<h4>Lobster Race.</h4>

<p>Any number of men or boys may enter as contestants.
At a given signal runners turn around, get down
on all fours on the starting line, and speed to the goal
and return, going backwards and on all fours all the
way. It is remarkable, the great similarity to lobsters
out for a stroll!</p>


<h4>Hippity-hop.</h4>

<p>Girls are pitted against the men. The girls stand in
one line and the men in another, the first one in each
line being about fifteen feet away from a tree directly
in front of that line. At a signal the first girl and the
first man start hippity-hopping, each one up to and
around his tree and back to his line, touching the hand
of the next runner who immediately starts to hippity-hop
over the same course, while those who ran first go
to the end of the line. When the second runner gets
back, he touches the hand of the third one, and he too
hippity-hops to the tree and back, each one going at
once to the end of the line when he has finished. This
goes on till everyone has hopped and members of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
team whose last runner first touches the first runner’s
hand win the game and a dish of ice cream.</p>

<p>I have never yet seen a group of girls who couldn’t
out-hippity-hop any group of men!</p>


<h4>The Bottle Race.</h4>

<p>Six empty bottles are necessary for this race, milk
bottles, Coca-Cola bottles, almost any kind will do, but
it is preferable to have bottles that tip easily. Contestants
are divided into two lines. A rope has been
laid on the ground about twenty feet in front of these
lines and six bottles have been placed there, three for
each line. At a signal, the first one of each team runs
up to the rope, picks up his three bottles which are
lying on the ground, places them upright and runs back
to touch the hands of the next runner, who starts at once
for the goal, knocks the three bottles down, and hurries
back to touch off the next runner. He in turn stands
the bottles up again, while the next runner knocks them
down, and so on. If a bottle falls down the runner must
go back to stand it up again before he can touch the
the next runner. Each runner, when he has finished
and has touched off the next runner, goes to the end
of the line. The side whose last runner first touches
the first runner’s hand wins the race.</p>


<h4>Masculine Vanity Race.</h4>

<p>Contestants run the length of the course, about fifty
feet, take off their caps, shoes, coats, and ties, put them
on the ground, run to the starting point, back to their
clothes, put them on, and then race back to the starting
line. The one who arrives first, fully clothed, gets a
little vanity mirror as a reward!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span></p>


<h4>Cradle Roll.</h4>

<p>It is always possible to get certain wholesome hard
candies wrapped in bright colored papers, preferably
red. All Cradle Rollers are gathered into a small open
space and it is left to their mothers to tell them that
real, honest-to-goodness candy will be tossed up in the
air and that they are to scramble for it, and that the
one who gets the most will get a big red balloon! It is
perfectly all right for mothers to accompany the
scramblers as long as the children themselves pick up
the candy.</p>


<h4>Kindergartners.</h4>

<p>At a signal each youthful contestant is to run over
to the balloon man to get a balloon. As each one is
given his balloon he begins blowing it up and the one
who blows the biggest balloon in the shortest time gets
a bag of peanuts.</p>

<p>You know what happens to fat Jimmy Pond! He
blows like a north wind, determined that his balloon
shall be the largest. It is—for one second, and then it
pops!</p>


<h4>Niagara Falls.</h4>

<p>Two in each team, one of them provided with a glass
of water, the glass full to the brim, and balanced on his
head. At a signal from the leader, No. 1 of each team,
with the water on his head, walks as rapidly as he dares
to the goal, about fifteen feet away, and returns to give
the glass to No. 2 of his team who does the same thing,
trying of course to be the first one to return to the
starting point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>His glass however must still be at least half full of
water if he hopes to win the prize. <i>Some</i> water spills.
We hope for that! But no one is allowed to spill more
than half of it without going back for a fresh supply.
Anyone who drops a glass and spills all his water, goes
back to the starting point, is loaned a towel, given
another glassful of water, and is started out again on
his perilous journey!</p>


<h4>Wheelbarrow Race.</h4>

<p>Four on each team, two drivers and two passengers.
Wheelbarrows are all set at the starting point with
passengers No. 1 sitting in them and drivers No. 1 all
ready to go. At the signal they are off to the goal and
return, the drivers dumping their passengers without
ceremony, and turning their wheelbarrows over to
drivers No. 2, who hustle their passengers into the wheelbarrows
and repeat the performance. It is always surprising
to note how many men have forgotten how to
propel a wheelbarrow, and even more surprising to see
how few people can ride in one easily and comfortably!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Many of the events under “Races” may be used
as Picnic Races.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Picnic Games.</i></h3>


<h4>Couple Baseball.</h4>

<p>There are eighteen on a team, nine men and nine
boys. The diamond is very small, not more than eighteen
feet across, and preferably very grassy. The game
is played exactly like Indoor Baseball except that every
player is riding a “horse.” The boys are the riders
and the men the horses. Horses are down on all fours
with riders astride their backs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span></p>

<p>The pitcher, who is perched on his horse, begins pitching
and the boy up to bat, who is sitting with difficulty
on a fat horse, makes a hit out toward center field.
Immediately his horse starts for first base, while center
field on his horse goes on a mad chase after the ball.
No player is allowed to leave his horse voluntarily.
There are times, however, when it is involuntary. For
some unknown reason, horses hurrying from one base
to another or chasing a ball, find humor in the situation
and a prone position for both rider and horse is the
inevitable result!</p>


<h4>Out!</h4>

<p>This game must be played within an inclosure. If
no rope is available, certain trees may be pointed out
as forming the boundary line and anyone going outside
the boundaries is out. The game is a great deal of fun
when the players number from twenty to forty, and four
or five balls are used. The balls should be either very
soft Indoor baseballs which have been considerably
battered, or the larger Playground ball.</p>

<p>The leader tosses these balls into the center, which is
the signal for the game to begin. Those nearest the
balls pick them up and throw them at someone. If the
people at whom the balls are thrown catch them, all is
well, but if they do not, and are hit by the ball, they
are out, and must go outside the boundaries. The game
continues in this way until all but one have been hit.
You can be sure he has had to be pretty agile!</p>

<p>Sad experience will prompt any leader to issue the
warning that no one is allowed to aim above the shoulder,
and in any case, no swift balls are allowed.</p>

<p>It makes for real humor when Mr. Black sees Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Carnes aiming a ball at him and he either dodges or
catches it, and is crowing in triumph, when along comes
a well aimed ball from the rear and hits him smack
between the shoulders, and he is out!</p>


<h4>Duck on the Rock.</h4>

<p>Each of the players, of whom there are from twelve
to fifteen, provides himself with a small rock. Players
stand in a line about twenty feet back of the duck, the
rock belonging to “It.” This duck is placed on a large
flat stone. When they are all ready, the signal to throw
is given. They take turns throwing at the duck, each
one trying to knock it off. No one succeeds however.
This means that they must take a stand near their own
rocks, and whenever they see the opportunity, snatch
up their rocks and run home, home being the line from
which they threw. If “It” is able to tag someone who
has his rock in his hand, that person becomes the new
“It” and his rock becomes the duck.</p>

<p>Immediately they begin throwing at the duck again,
and while the first four fail to knock it off and are
obliged to stand next to their rocks until they see a
chance to run home, the fifth thrower is successful in
knocking off the duck, and all those waiting to run home
snatch up their rocks and run, for “It” cannot tag
anyone while the duck is off the rock, and they may all
go home in safety. As soon as he gets his duck back
on again, however, he may tag anyone who is touching
his rock, or running home with it in his hand.</p>

<p>One rule of this game invariably brings about the
funniest and most awkward situations! If a person
once touches his rock, thinking he sees a chance to run
home, and “It” turns around unexpectedly, thereby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
making the safe run home a doubtful thing, the player
is not allowed to drop his rock but must pick it up and
run for all he is worth, even though his chances of
getting past “It” are as nothing!</p>


<h4>Triple Dodge Ball.</h4>

<p>For a group of men and boys at a picnic, there is no
game any livelier or more exciting than Triple Dodge
Ball. It is played just like the more familiar “Dodge
Ball” except that three balls instead of one are used.
A large circle is made, players numbering from twenty
to sixty. They count off by twos, numbering “1,” “2,”
“1,” “2,” all around the circle. All the 1’s go into the
center while the 2’s make a rather large circle around
them. Three soft basketballs are distributed among the
2’s and at a signal from the leader they start to throw
the balls at those in the center, no one being allowed to
aim higher than the knees. Anyone who is hit must
leave the center and join the circle made by the 2’s.
When all of the 1’s have been hit they change places
with the 2’s, the 2’s going into the center and the 1’s
making the circle.</p>

<p>When all of the 2’s have been hit, the last 1 and the
last 2 to leave the circle are called back into the center
to decide which of the two sides is the more agile in
dodging the ball. A very large circle is made to give
them plenty of room. Of course all of the 1’s will make
every effort to hit the No. 2 who is in the center and
the 2’s will hardly be remiss when it comes to aiming at
the No. 1 who is dodging them!</p>

<p>One rule must be enforced. No player is allowed to
leave his place in the circle to throw the ball. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
such a temptation to take just a few steps inside the
circle to get a better aim!</p>


<h4>Family Hide and Go Seek.</h4>

<p>A limited area must be defined on the picnic ground.
The one who is hiding cannot go outside that area. Only
one of a group goes out to hide. After giving him some
three or four minutes in which to hide, the rest of the
group go after him. They must go out singly, not even
two people being allowed to hunt together. The reason
for this is soon apparent. As soon as a hunter finds
the one who is hiding, instead of setting up an alarm,
he hides with him. The next one does the same, and
so on, until they have all found the one who was hiding.
The last one to find him is given the title “Booby!”</p>

<p>The one who first found the hider is the one who will
go out to hide the next time.</p>


<h4>Backward Tug of War.</h4>

<p>The only difference between this and the ordinary tug
of war is that all pullers must face away from the
center, the two opposing teams having their backs to
each other! You can imagine what that does to the
losing side that starts to slip!</p>


<h4>Two Deep.</h4>

<p>This is played just like the old-fashioned “Three
Deep” except that it is only two deep. Guests stand in
a single circle, with “It” and the one who is being
chased on the outside. The one who is chased runs
around the circle and suddenly cuts inside and stands in
front of some other player with his back to him. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
player is the runner then and he must fly to get away
from “It,” who is close on his heels. When he too gets
inside and stands with his back to some other player he
is safe, but the one in front of whom he stands is the
next runner. If he gets caught he becomes “It” and the
former “It” gets to safety by standing in front of some
unfortunate friend of his.</p>


<h4>Follow the Leader.</h4>

<p>Anyone who wishes may join the line of march and
drop out at any time it is getting too difficult for him,
but no one is allowed to rejoin a line after once having
dropped out to rest. The leader does the usual stunts
of “Follow the Leader.” These stunts may include:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#160; 1. A short dog-trot.<br>
&#160; 2. A hippity-hop.<br>
&#160; 3. Walking on all fours.<br>
&#160; 4. Walking backwards.<br>
&#160; 5. Running on tiptoes.<br>
&#160; 6. Climbing a designated tree.<br>
&#160; 7. Going through a barrel.<br>
&#160; 8. Hopping on one foot.<br>
&#160; 9. Jumping a creek.<br>
10. Turning a somersault.</p>
</div>

<h4>One-Legged Pom Pom Pull Away.</h4>

<p>This is played just like the old “Pom Pom Pull Away”
except that all players and “It” are compelled to hop
on one foot. Players line up on the “home” line, with
“It” facing them in an open space some thirty feet in
width. At the signal all players must leave home and
hop on one foot to the opposite side of the open space.
“It” chases them, he too being allowed only one foot.
Anyone he tags while in the open space must come to
the center with him and help him catch the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span></p>


<h4>The Rooster Fight.</h4>

<p>The group is divided into two even sides, each person
having an opponent assigned him. At the signal each
one starts “fighting” his opponent in the following way:
The right hand is put on the hip, and hopping on the
right foot, the rooster tries to bump his enemy in such
a way that he is compelled to put down his left foot to
keep his balance. If he does do that he is out of the
game.</p>

<p>When the issue has been decided between all opponents,
all the winners are called out, and they are again
paired off with opponents. This is repeated until there
are only two left to compete for the bumper championship.
The one who wins gets a toy rooster.</p>


<h4>The Target.</h4>

<p>Some thirty to forty men players form two long lines
facing each other not more than five feet apart. The
one who by the process of “counting out” is chosen to
be the first target, is to walk through these lines while
the players punish him in various ways! Of course no
one is allowed to touch his head or to really strike
hard, but many very successful “taps” are possible!
However, it is not as one-sided as it might appear. If
the target is successful in being able to turn around
quickly enough to actually see someone hit him, that
someone immediately becomes the new target, and he
too must walk up and down the line with head bent until
he is able to catch someone in the very act of hitting
him.</p>


<h4>Poison Ball.</h4>

<p>Small circles are formed with not more than fifteen
players to a circle, one of the players being in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
center. Someone in each circle is given an Indoor baseball
and at the starting signal throws it across the circle
to another player. If the one in the center catches the
ball while it is going through the air the one who threw
it becomes “It,” and takes the place in the center.
Moreover, if “It” can touch the ball while it is still
in some player’s hand, that player becomes “It.”</p>

<p>The one object of the game is to get the ball out of
one’s hands before “It” can touch it.</p>


<h4>Picnic Stagecoach.</h4>

<p>A grassy plot is essential for this boys’ game. It is
played very much like “Stagecoach,” in that each
player, all of them seated on chairs, is given a part to
represent. One may be a wheel, another the brake,
another the door, etc., etc. The leader, who is on all
fours, tells the story of an eventful ride on the stagecoach
and as he calls out the name of the different parts
they line up behind him on all fours. Finally all parts
are assembled and the stagecoach moves off on its journey
around the grassy plot. Suddenly an awful accident
occurs and with an awful “Bang!” the whole thing
falls apart, and all parts must hurry back to their chairs
still on all fours.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the leader was on all fours
at the beginning of the game and had no chair. Therefore
there will be someone who will be left without a
chair. That person is the next story teller and tells
the tale of what happened to the stagecoach, all the
players having in the meanwhile changed parts with
each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span></p>


<h3><i>Tag Games.</i></h3>


<h4>Sing Tag.</h4>

<p>This is one of the funniest tag games that ever left
a person breathless from laughing. “It” is chasing
some great big fellow and this big fellow cannot run
another step, so to save himself from being caught he
starts to sing at the top of his lungs and—he is safe!
The minute “It” starts to go away, he may stop singing
but that is the only way any player can be safe, to loudly
sing some song no other player is singing!</p>


<h4>Cripple Tag.</h4>

<p>“It” must clasp his hands behind him and tag with
his shoulder only.</p>


<h4>Three in One.</h4>

<p>Three players are “It” and must run with arms
linked. To catch anyone they must encircle him. The
one whom they catch hooks on to the right end of their
line and the one on the left end is no longer “It” but
goes free. The next one who is caught does the same
thing, links arms with the right end of the “It” line
and the one on the left end is free. That will make
your “Its” change constantly.</p>

<p>If you think it an easy matter to get away from three
“Its” just try it!</p>


<h4>Ouch!</h4>

<p>“It” runs around trying to tag someone in some spot
that is remote from a runner’s hand.</p>

<p>He finally tags Jimmy right between the shoulders.
Jimmy becomes “It” and must run around with his left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
hand on the place on which he was tagged, between the
shoulders. But Jim gets his revenge because in just
about no time he tags Harry on the heel and Harry has
to be “It” with his hand on his heel. “It” must always
keep his left hand on the place he was tagged. If there
are any fat guests present tag them on the toe, and
watch them run around with their hands on their toes!</p>


<h4>Ankle Tag.</h4>

<p>A limited space is advisable with not more than thirty
men or boys as contestants. Let trees make a boundary
line. No one is allowed to go outside that line. “It”
is chasing Mr. Jones, who, wishing to save himself, looks
for the nearest ankle as a safety spot. It belongs to
Billy Sprowls. Mr. Jones clutches that ankle, thereby
making both himself and Billy safe. Jack Knight has
Billy’s other ankle and he too is safe. “It” looks for
another victim who perhaps makes a noble effort to get
an ankle but just as he is about to lay hold on it, the
owner of the ankle flees, leaving him in the clutches of
the enemy. If he is tagged he becomes “It.” A whistle
is blown every time a new “It” is installed, to avoid
confusion.</p>

<p>Perhaps “It” thinks that some people are playing
safe too long at a stretch, so he may call out “Fruit
basket!” and everyone must change his position.</p>

<p>The rules are very simple. They are as follows:</p>

<p>1. Anyone grasping an ankle is safe. So is the owner
of the ankle. Any number of people may grasp the
same ankle.</p>

<p>2. Anyone not touching an ankle who is tagged, is
“It.”</p>

<p>3. A whistle is blown every time a new “It” is put in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>

<p>4. A call of “Fruit basket!” makes it necessary for
everyone to change his position.</p>

<p>One of the funniest phases of the game is the inevitable
situation in which Mr. Jaeck, fat and forty and
funny, makes a flying leap for an ankle, only to have
the ankle pass on! You know where it leaves that Mr.
Jaeck!</p>


<h4>Tail Tag.</h4>

<p>All players are arranged in columns, four in each
column, the one in front with arms stretched out, while
the others have their hands on the shoulders of the one
in front of them. At a signal the last one in each group
steps out to the front and faces his column. He is
“It,” and it is his business to catch the tail, the last
one of the column. The column, however, does everything
possible to prevent his tagging the tail. The one
in front with his arms stretched out widely, leads the
defense and the rest of the team just hangs on blindly.
The leader must keep his arms stiff while “It” tries
every possible means of dodging around those arms in
his effort to tag the tail. If he succeeds, the tail becomes
“It,” while the former “It” goes to the head of
the line, and the chase to tag the new tail is on.</p>

<p>In their frantic protection of their tail, someone of a
column may fall down. Tell them all beforehand that
that offense is forgivable only if they will jump up at
once, whether they can or not!</p>


<h4>Backward Tag.</h4>

<p>Ralph is “It” and is chasing Bob. Bob wants to
save himself so he jumps behind Fred and stands with
his back against Fred’s back, which makes both Bob and
Fred safe. Ralph immediately goes out to catch Billy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
but Billy too, flies to find a neighbor with whom he can
stand back to back, for anyone who stands with his back
against that of another player is safe. But finally Ralph
catches Don before he can get to another boy’s back
and Don is “It.”</p>

<p>It is true that as long as a boy stands back to back
with another boy, they are both safe, but if “It” thinks
they are playing safe too much he just calls out “Fruit
Basket” and every boy has to move away from his safety
spot and run to find another.</p>


<h4>All Fours.</h4>

<p>“It” is chasing Walter, and Walter cannot run another
step so he flops down on all fours and he is safe.
No runner who is on all fours can be tagged but to see
to it that he is not so comfortable that he will stay there
for the rest of the game, he is not allowed to sit down
as he always wants to, but must stay on all fours as long
as he wants to play safe.</p>


<h4>Kamerad!</h4>

<p>To be safe, a boy lies down on his back with arms and
legs stretched up in the air. You can be sure that he
will not stay there very long, so your game will be a
lively one!</p>


<h4>Forehead Tag.</h4>

<p>To be safe from being tagged, a boy must have his
forehead on the ground. There is never any trouble in
Forehead Tag of boys playing safe too long!</p>


<h4>Horse Tag.</h4>

<p>Three boys make a horse, the head, the body, and the
tail. The player who is being chased by “It” hooks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
on to the tail of a horse and calls out loudly “Gallop!”
whereupon the head, who really is no longer the head,
becomes the runner and must get away before “It”
catches him. If he is caught he becomes “It” and the
former “It” runs to safety by hooking on a horse’s tail.</p>

<p>Sometimes the head doesn’t hear the call “Gallop”
when a runner hooks on to his tail, but he is not excused,
for it is up to each head to watch his tail and avoid a
runner who wants to hook on if possible. This makes
the game far more exciting, for all the horses are dodging
the runner who is dodging “It” and wants to catch on
to a tail and be safe!</p>


<h4>Hop Tag.</h4>

<p>All players and “It” must use only one foot in moving
around. When they are standing still and resting
they may have both feet on the ground, but as soon as
they start to move they must use only one foot.</p>


<h4>Circle Tag.</h4>

<p>Players form a large circle with enough room between
each runner so that no one of them can be touched by
the one behind him. At the starting signal they begin
a slow dog-trot which at a call from the leader develops
into a run.</p>

<p>Finally they are given the word “Go” which means
that each one may run as fast as he can, and if possible
tag the one in front of him, which puts him out of the
race.</p>

<p>The circle gets smaller and smaller until finally there
are only two runners chasing each other in a circle. It
looks exactly like a dog chasing his own tail!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br>

<small>PARTNERS, REFRESHMENTS, AND DINNER TABLE
AMUSEMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<h3><i>To Find Partners.</i></h3>


<h4>Millinery.</h4>

<p>All the men line up for marching. The line of
march leads through the ladies’ cloakroom, where each
man is to take the hat nearest him, put it on, and continue
in the march which leads back to the main room.
There the men parade up and down the room until each
hat and its “occupant” is claimed by some lady.</p>


<h4>String Partners. <span class="unbold">(Small Group.)</span></h4>

<p>A large paper heart is suspended in a doorway. A
hole has been pierced in it, large enough to hold half
as many strings as there are people present. These
strings have been put through the hole just as evenly
as possible. When the time for choosing partners has
arrived, every man takes hold of a string on one side
and every girl takes one on the other. At the signal
from the leader they pull down, tearing the heart and
straightening out their strings without letting go, to
find out who has the other end. That “other end” is of
course one’s partner.</p>


<h4>Taking a Chance!</h4>

<p>The men are blindfolded while the girls all line up in
a row. The men are led up one by one to the row of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
girls and are asked to go down the row, shaking hands
with each girl in turn until they come to the girl they
want for a partner. They are warned that they cannot
go to the end of the row and then come back for another
chance, but that if they have not chosen by the time they
come to the last girl, this last one will be their partner.
Girls are not allowed to indicate in any way who they
are. Any girl who does is put at the end of the line.</p>


<h4>Proposals. <span class="unbold">(Small Group.)</span></h4>

<p>Two widths of wrapping paper are pasted together
so that they form a curtain. The ladies stand behind
this with their left hands stuck through the paper. All
means of identification, such as rings, have been removed.
The men have been provided with ten cent store rings,
no two alike, and as they pass down the line, reviewing
the hands, they put the ring on the finger of the lady
of their choice. When all the ladies have been presented
with rings, the curtain is dropped and the men claim
their rings and their partners.</p>


<h4>Professions. <span class="unbold">(Small Group.)</span></h4>

<p>The men have been given cards on which are written
the professions each one of them is to pantomime. The
ladies have been given cards on which corresponding
professions are named, and as soon as each lady recognizes
the profession being pantomimed as the one corresponding
with hers, she claims her partner.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, she makes a mistake. She thinks
a man is pantomiming the dentist’s profession, whereas
in reality he is a piano tuner!</p>

<p>The following professions may be used to good dramatic
advantage:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#160; 1. Piano tuner.<br>
&#160; 2. Dentist.<br>
&#160; 3. Surgeon.<br>
&#160; 4. Teacher.<br>
&#160; 5. Hairdresser.<br>
&#160; 6. Vocal Teacher.<br>
&#160; 7. Artist.<br>
&#160; 8. Judge.<br>
&#160; 9. Riding Master.<br>
10. Actor.</p>
</div>

<h4>Rhyming Partners.</h4>

<p>Familiar rhymes are cut in two, one side being placed
on a plate for the men and the other side on a plate for
the ladies. The two plates are passed to the men and
ladies respectively, and it is the business of each man
to find the lady who has the other half of his rhyme.</p>

<p>When they have all found their partners, before they
can have any refreshments, if this is refreshment time,
each couple in turn must stand before the others and
glibly recite the nursery rhyme found on their cards.</p>


<h4>Superlatives. <span class="unbold">(Small Group.)</span></h4>

<p>In this case it is the girls who must find partners.
They are given cards on which are written brief, two-word
descriptions of the men who will act as their partners.
The descriptions may be similar to those following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#160; 1. Biggest foot.<br>
&#160; 2. Nicest looking.<br>
&#160; 3. Smallest hand.<br>
&#160; 4. “Shiningest” eyes.<br>
&#160; 5. Curliest hair.<br>
&#160; 6. Broadest shoulders.<br>
&#160; 7. Sweetest disposition.<br>
&#160; 8. Best dancer.<br>
&#160; 9. Most extravagant.<br>
10. Pearliest teeth.</p>
</div>

<p>The girls are given their cards, are asked to say nothing
about what is on them but to silently look at the
men for two full minutes and then to quietly go and
claim their partners. In case of any dispute, the leader
settles the argument. After all the men have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
claimed each girl must give her reason, based on the
description on her card, for choosing the partner she did.</p>


<h4>The Hunt.</h4>

<p>This may make a real game for a group of guests if
the place in which they are being entertained is large
enough to afford a great many hiding places. Each
guest is given a card and he is to follow directions
explicitly, for each card will direct him to another card,
and so forth, the goal being one’s partner. All cards
have been carefully worked out beforehand, to be sure
there are no slip-ups, or duplications.</p>

<p>We might follow Miss Gail as she follows directions
on her cards.</p>

<p>Her first card reads, “Go look on the third shelf of
the music cabinet.” There she finds another card
which bids her go up to the front bedroom and look under
the red pin-cushion. The card there asks her to
look under the gas stove in the kitchen for further instructions.
Next she is to look under the foreleg of
the wash machine in the laundry, and there she finds a
card which tells her that she will find her partner in
the living room on the couch.</p>

<p>He, in the meantime, has had just as varied a journey,
and his last instructions were to look on the couch
in the living room for a charming partner.</p>

<p>When the weather permits, it adds a great deal to
put part of these different trips out-of-doors.</p>


<h4>The Matrimonial Bureau. <span class="unbold">(Small Group.)</span></h4>

<p>Early in the evening every guest is given a piece of
paper and a pencil, and is asked to write out his or her
ideal of a perfect husband or wife. Names are signed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
on the backs of these descriptions, and the papers are
collected. Later in the evening, just before refreshments,
the papers written up by the ladies are given
out to the men, and vice versa. Then some man designated
by the hostess reads aloud the description handed
him and says in addition, “Marion Davis wrote this.
This is her idea of a perfect husband; which of us is
he?” and by popular vote the men pick out the perfect
partner for Marion Davis.</p>

<p>She has her turn too, however. She reads the idea
given her, announces who wrote it, and then asks the
ladies to help her find the perfect partner for this deluded
man. They do so joyfully!</p>

<p>Thus it goes around the entire group. Each one
reads his description, tells who wrote it, and the group
picks out the ideal partner for each one. Some of them
have difficulty in recognizing themselves.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Unless otherwise designated, all these events may
be used for either large or small groups.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Refreshments.</i></h3>

<p>Refreshments should be served when the evening is
just about two-thirds over. Every social committee
wants guests to go home feeling that the evening has
been a tremendous success from start to finish. The
committee takes a chance as to their going home with
that feeling when refreshments are the last thing on
the program. Some of them finish before others, and
finally a group decides that it is time to go home and
they start out. Others follow them, and eventually
they all drift out, but with a more or less vague and
indefinite feeling of being let down at the end of a
mighty fine evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>It has proved to be far more effective to carry the
fun right through refreshment time, then have a few
more games, finally closing your evening with a game
that brings in everyone, the kind of game that makes
one have a new respect for one’s capacity for laughing.
Let that game end in “Good-Night Ladies,” and your
guests go home refreshed and relaxed and absolutely
convinced that they never had a better time in their
lives.</p>

<p>However, there is a pause sometimes, during refreshments,
which, instead of promoting sociability, promotes
a letting down of interest. It comes when some
of them have finished and others have just begun their
refreshments. That is a splendid time to put on informal
singing. It isn’t at all necessary to get people out
of their seats to sit in straight rows in front of the
piano. Those who have finished may come up to the
piano. Popular songs and old songs are always very
effective, and a few foolish ones never fail to make the
slower eaters hurry up and join the crowd. For example,
let them sing “Smiles.” Then ask them to sing
it omitting the word “smile.” In its place they are to
smile sweetly at their neighbors. It is so easy to smile
sweetly when one is convulsed with laughter!</p>

<p>Another good impromptu song is “John Brown’s
Baby Had a Cold Upon Its Chest.” It is sung to the
tune of “John Brown’s Body.” The first line is repeated
twice. The fourth line is, “And they rubbed
it with camphorated oil.” At first it is sung in perfectly
proper fashion, but the second time the word
“baby” is omitted and an imaginary baby is rocked.
The third verse omits both “baby” and “cold,” a
sneeze taking the place of the cold. In the next verse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
the same two words are omitted, and in addition
“chest” is left out and pantomimed by a hearty slap
on one’s chest. Next omit “rubbed,” rubbing one’s
chest instead, and lastly omit “camphorated oil,”
pinching one’s nose as decidedly indicative of one’s
feelings toward the oil.</p>

<p>If the song is not allowed to drag, the last verse usually
leaves your guests helpless, for although there is
almost no singing left to be done, the violent pantomiming
is enough to reduce them all to tears!</p>

<p>If a program of entertainment features has been
planned this same “in-between” time has proved to be
a far better time for it than the first half hour which
is usually given it. If the program is made up of
several numbers, ask the men to get up and change
partners between numbers. A five cent fine is imposed
on any man sitting with the same partner for two successive
numbers.</p>

<p>Stunts, too, always fit in well at this time, both impromptu
stunts and three or four which have needed
a little preparation.</p>

<p>After the refreshment hour is over it is always a
good plan to get all guests on their feet in some big
group game, not alone for the digestive value of such
an action, but for the social value as well.</p>

<p>The following stunts are typical of the kind of stunt
which is particularly good for that “in-between time”
directly after refreshments.</p>


<h4>Head-Work.</h4>

<p>A quartette is announced, made up of people who
really can sing, and whose success is laid at the door
of the director who has devised a new and highly successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
method of getting the best out of one’s voice.
He stands back of the quartette, which is seated facing
the audience. When they are ready he starts the music
by pushing down the head of the one who sings first,
and thereafter keeps on the jump, pushing down the
heads of the music-makers. When all four sing together
he has a lively time, but by using both his elbows
and his hands he manages to push down all four heads
at once.</p>

<p>Usually they are heartily applauded, both for their
nonsense and for their really good music. Even if they
are not, however, they bow and respond with an encore.
This time something goes wrong with the mechanism,
and though they sing something old and familiar like
Home Sweet Home, when a head is pushed down for a
certain necessary note, a certain other note comes forth
instead, and what is worse, a note gets loose, and
doesn’t wait for the push on the head that insures harmony.
It all ends in one final blare of awful discord,
and the master drives them out in despair.</p>


<h4>The Pygmy Choir.</h4>

<p>Another stunt that is both delightful to listen to and
highly interesting to watch is that of the pygmy choir.
When the curtain of the stage is drawn a large sheet
of paper is seen, with eight heads shown through holes
cut in the paper, and eight pairs of long legs charcoaled
on the paper below the dresses, and eight artistic charcoaled
hats on the paper above the heads. The holes
must be large enough to plainly show the faces of the
singers, who are men. The effect is grotesque, to say
the least—eight masculine faces attached to eight frivolous
little bodies dressed in crêpe paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>There is nothing frivolous about their music, however,
until just at the last of the encore, when one man
loses his dress, which had not been pasted on, but which
he held on by means of a pin. His distress, which is
loud and lamenting, breaks up the choir.</p>


<h4>Bedlam.</h4>

<p>One person comes out and sings a well-known song
in English. It is heartily applauded, but instead of an
encore someone else comes out and sings the same song
in French; then it is sung in Spanish; in Swedish;
Italian; Dutch; and Norwegian. Finally, all of them
come out and sing the song together, each in his own
language, and each trying to outdo the other in being
heard. It is always appreciated by an audience, this
melody!</p>


<h4>A Chinese Reading.</h4>

<p>Some well-known local person is announced as about
to give a reading, with no hint in the announcement of
any foolishness. The reading is extraordinary, only
in that it is given backwards!</p>

<p>It really is not difficult to memorize a piece backwards,
if one will write it out that way before attempting
to memorize it. The difficult part comes in listening
to it!</p>

Amateur Entertainments.” Dutton &amp; Co., N. Y.</p>
</div>


<h3><i>Dinner Table Amusement.</i></h3>

<p>There are so many hostesses at dinner parties, to
whom the preparation of the dinner and its serving are
not the awful bugbear. That honor goes rather to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
painful silences that spoil the best dinner ever served.
There is only one thing more painful. That is a very
evident attempt to make conversation, and to force a
social atmosphere.</p>

<p>The following “Dinner Table Amusement” has been
given every conceivable test as to real ice-breaking
capability. It has been found, too, that much of it can
be used to just as good advantage at church and school
and club and community suppers, as at smaller affairs in
the home. Where there are several tables or very long
tables it is a good plan to have one person at every
table or every section of a long table, who is responsible
for putting on the various stunts.</p>

<p>All of these stunts are included in other chapters of
this book. The following are examples:</p>

<p>1. Crystal gazing. This trick is infallible. It has
never yet failed to gain the most helpless laughter of
the evening. Instead of having the victim kneel, however,
when this is done at the table, ask him to put his
hands on the table, with fingers spread out wide. A
good time to bring this in is just after dessert has been
served, particularly if that dessert is tempting. Your
victim is utterly helpless, and it is not an unheard of
thing for another guest to calmly eat the delicious apple
pie that stands idle.</p>

<p>Another good time to do it is just after dinner is
over, and the other guests depart, leaving Mr. Unfortunate
to sit alone for a moment to reflect on his sins.</p>

<p>2. Virtues. This may be put on between courses, but
partners are not changed.</p>

<p>3. Mimic. Vocal gymnastics are possible, but because
guests are seated, no “funny steps” are used.</p>

<p>The following may be used just as they are:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span></p>

<table>
<tr><td>1. Paralysis.</td><td>      13. Prison guard.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2. Help!</td><td>      14. Hee haw!</td></tr>
<tr><td>3. Be Definite.</td><td>      15. Impossible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4. Prohibited Words.</td><td>      16. Palmistry.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5. Dressing up.</td><td>      17. Mr. Bumps.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6. Hear! hear!</td><td>      18. Wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7. Abbreviations.</td><td>      19. Self praise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8. And I.</td><td>       20. “T.”</td></tr>
<tr><td>9. Elastic Spelling.</td><td>      21. Eny.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10. Owa Tagoo Siam. &#160; &#160; </td><td>      22. Unbreakable match.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11. Under the table.</td><td>      23. Rubber!</td></tr>
<tr><td>12. Willie.</td><td>      24. Elastic ring.</td></tr>
</table>


<h4>Conversation.</h4>

<p>After the ice has been broken one feels safe in guiding
the conversation along certain lines between partners,
confident that conversation will not seem forced.
The following topics are not conducive to forced conversation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. My most thrilling adventure.<br>
2. The most fun I ever had.<br>
3. The “scaredest” I’ve ever been.<br>
4. The biggest fish story I know.<br>
5. The oldest joke I know.</p>
